About half a mile westward is the hamlet of Cortes, with its post office and merchant shops; also in the vicinity *Momnond House*, the residence of Miss Strachan, delightfully situated; *Cairness House*, the elegant seat of J. W. Gordon, Esq., partially seen. It was built in 1793, at a cost of about £25,000, by the grandfather of the present proprietor (1865), from a design by Playfair.
