Text:

After the bustle incident to the arrival of fresh passengers, and the departure of others, has in some degree subsided, it will be found that the arrangements for the comfort and convenience of those alighting at this station are equal, if not superior, to those of any other line.

A magnificent hotel, for aristocratic visitors, here so frequently found, is within a few minutes' walk, and numerous taverns, less ornamental, and, consequently, less expensive, are in the immediate neighbourhood.

Slough is now chiefly noticeable as the station or medium of communication, by the branch railway, to Eton and Windsor. It is two and a half miles in length, and passes Eton College, near the Thames.
