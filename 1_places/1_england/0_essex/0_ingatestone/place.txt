Text: This town, which contains a population of 882, derives its name from Ing (a meadow) and alte (the Roman mill-stone). The church contains monuments and effigies of the Petre family, who formerly lived at their old seat, *Ingatestone Hall*. In the vicinity is *The Hyde*, seat of the Disneys, one of whom discovered at Blunt's Walls, near Billericay, the *Disney Antiquities*, placed in the Fitzwilliam Museum.
