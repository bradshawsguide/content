Text:

In the vicinity is *Poynton Hall*, seat of Lord Vernon, who rebuilt it, together with *St. Mary's Church* in 1789; and about 1¼ mile to the east, *Lyme Hall*, T. Legh, Esq., is partly ancient, and standsin a vast park, or forest, once abounding in red deer. Sir Perkin & Legh was the favourite follower of the Black Prince, from whom the estate was inherited; their pictures are preserved here (in armour), with the Prince's bed, and other relics. It is a question however, if the portraits are authentic, though they are undoubtedly ancient.
