[Fazakerley](/stations/fazakerley), [Preston Road](/stations/fazakerley), and [Bootle Lane](/stations/bootle-lane) stations.

The entrance to Liverpool may be said to commence at the Walton tunnel. Immediately after leaving the tunnel the line crosses the Leeds and Liverpool Canal by a wooden bowstring bridge of a novel and peculiar construction. A short embankment succeeds, followed by a series of arches and bridges, by which the line is carried into the town.

From Edmund Street to Tithebarn Street, the line is continued by means of arches to the station, the interior of which presents ample accommodation for the traffic of the various lines. Each company has a separate departure station, but the arrival station is for their use in common. The passenger station at Tithebarn Street is covered in by two iron roofs, one of which is of great magnitude, being 136 feet span, without any intermediate supports.
The area covered by this single roof alone, is 83,457 square feet. This root is entirely of iron. It is lighted by four lines of skylights, and is ventilated by galvanised wrought iron courses.

The booking offices and waiting roms are in a handsome stone building, in the Italian style of architecture, having a frontage to Tithebarn Street, and at right angles to this are two wings, one story high, the one having a frontage to Key Street, and the other to Bixteth Street. In these are contained two distinct sets of waiting and refreshment rooms, one for either company.

The front to Tithebarn Street consists of a two story building, containing a hooking office for each company, and over these the committee rooms and other offices.

The station is approached from Tithebarn Street by two large ornamental iron gates, having massive stone piers. From these an incline road brings carriages to the level of the platform, while the approach for foot-passengers is up a flight of stone steps.

One of the immediate effects of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was to make the latter town a great centre, from which the supply of the manufacturing towns diverged. Many of these places were felt to be of too great importance to rely upon a single and indirect market, and hence it was resolved to connect them with the Liverpool seaport, on which they so much depended.

Amongst the places so circumstanced were Wigan, Bolton, and Bury; to connect which with Liverpool, the Liverpool, Bolton, and Bury Railway Co. transformed. Subsequently events changed and extended the design, and the Lancashire and Yorkshire, and the East Lancashire Railways became jointly interested in the speculation as a great artery for the traffic. The companies found it essential to make Liverpool a grand terminus; and, by their united efforts, the people of Liverpool possess a direct. communication with the whole of the important districts of Yorkshire and Lancashire. The Lancashire and Yorkshire carries the traffic of the two Ridings; together with a considerable portion of that for the eastern districts of North and South Lancashire; and the Liverpool and Southport, a part of the same system, opens out the traffic of Bootle and Waterloo.
