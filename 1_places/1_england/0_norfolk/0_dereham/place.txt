Text: The Church of St. Nicholas, which was founded by Withburga, the daughter of an Anglian monarch, should be visited; its font, with carved figures, and chest in Edward's Chapel will be appreciated. Here lie buried the poet Cowper, who died at his cousin's in 1S00, and Mrs. Unwin; there is an epitaph on his tomb by Hayley. In the vicinity is *Quebec Castle*, seat of W. Warner, Esq.
