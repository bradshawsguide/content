This line of railway, 13 miles in length, traverses a flat but richly-productive country, as well as an extensive and valuable coal district. Leaving Eccles, the line turns off at [Monton Green](/stations/monton-green) Junction, and almost immediately crosses the Bridgewater Canal, with its tardy horse-boats, at once vividly suggestive of the vast contrast between the past and present mode of locomotion; the iron-horse seeming to snort defiantly at its sluggish competitor below. The distant spire, rising gracefully upward amidst the surrounding greenery that environs the church, remind us of our approach to

(place: england/lancashire/worsley)

The nest station is [Ellenbrook](/stations/ellenbrook). We then cross *Worsley Common*, passing *Peel Hall*, a timber and plaster building, charmingly situated to our right, the residence of H. Blair, Esq. It was built in 1630, and has a great number of old rooms and portraits. Good views of Leigh and the Cheshire hills may be got from the park.

[Tyldesley](/stations/tyldesley)--The view from this station is magnificent--a long expanse of open country stretching as far as the eye can reach.

(branch: start)
  A short branch turns off to the left, passing through a fine productive country to [Bedford](/stations/bedford-leigh), situated one mile to the east of Leigh, but which may be almost considered as a part of it, and noted for its manufactories of silk, cotton, and machinery. The branch then proceeds to the junction with the Bolton and Kenyon line at [Bradshaw Leach](/stations/bradshaw-leach), and thence to [Kenyon](/stations/kenyon-junction), from whence trains may be taken to either Liverpool or Manchester.
(branch: end)

Returning to Tylesley, we pass onward to

[Chowbent](/stations/chowbent), a place famed for its dialectic peculiarities. On leaving this place we cross the Bolton and Kenyon line, with which it is connected by a Short branch, opening up communication with Bolton, and then pass on to

[Hindley Green](/stations/hindley-green), situated in the very heart of the coal district. The next station te come to is [Platt Bridge](/stations/platt-bridge), soon after leaving which we arrive at [Springs](/stations/springs), the junction with the North Union Line, and immediately after at
