We pass [Kirk Andrews](/stations/kirk-andrews) and [Burgh](/stations/burgh) stations, at the last of which, the Roman *Akelodunum*, there is an obelisk on the marsh, in memory of Edward I., who died here in 1307. At the old castle (which belonged to De Morville, one of a'Beckett's assassins), there is a Norman door and fortified tower; inscriptions, altars, &c., have been found here.
