text: At this station the railway reaches its greatest elevation, being 420 feet above the level of the sea, and 300 above that of Camden Town depot. This elevation is attained by a series of gradients never exceeding 1 in 300. The town of Tring has a handsome church containing some good monuments, and a curious enriched font.
