## Stafford to Crewe (Staffordshire)

(place: england/staffordshire/stafford)

Upon leaving Stafford station the castle appears on the left, and the town to the right of the line, which passes through somewhat marshy country, and uninteresting portion of the route.

(place: england/staffordshire/norton-bridge)

From this station, through [Standon Bridge](/stations/standon-bridge) the line proceeds through a similar monotonous prt of the country, occasionally diversified by the view of a beautiful park, or well-situated mansion—until we enter a deep cutting leading to

(place: england/staffordshire/whitmore)

Leaving the Whitmore station, the line passes over a considerable bed of peat and proceeds through a fine open country of pasture land.

(place: england/staffordshire/madeley)

The line proceeds from this station past a deep cutting through undulating hills, between which we obtain beautiful vistas of the country, and thence reach an embankment, whence we have a view of a most romantic dell, bounded by hills, abrupt precipices, and banks of heather. As far as we can see to the right the vale stretches out in variegated beauty. Passing onward the train proceeds along an embankment, beneath which passes the Wrine, which flows through the valley. A lofty embankment and two viaducts carrying the line through the valley of the Wrinehill, the village of that name appearing on the right, and *Wrine Hall* and *Hill*, forming pleasing objects in the prospect on the left. Soon after the line enters [Cheshire](/places/england/cheshire).

We next pass through the cutting of Bunker’s Hill, in the occasional openings of which we see *Betley* and *Betley Court*, a fine old English Hall, at the top of a rising lawn, surrounded with woods and fields, and adorned with a large sheet of water or lake in front, forming one of the most pleasant views on the line.

The hills in the vicinity command fine prospects of the country, which is delightfully varied with hills and vallies, woodland and pastures, a cursory view of which we obtain during our passage along the next embankment

(place: england/cheshire/basford)

From this station the line curves gently, and then proceeds in a straight direction. After passing through a cutting, and thence along an embankment, we perceive *Crewe Hall*, a very beautiful place, the building being one of those square structures which the nobility and gentry of this country were so partial to in the last century.

We again proceed over a somewhat high embankment, and obtain several fine views of the country between the line of road and Nantwich, over which are scattered hamlets and farm houses, intermingled with rich and luxuriant scenery, until we reach

(place: england/cheshire/crewe)
