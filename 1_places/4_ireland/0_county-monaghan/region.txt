title: County Monaghan
----
text: Monaghan, which returns two members, is situate in the province of Ulster. Although this county is much incumbered with mountains and bogs, great portions of it are highly cultivated and improved (especially the northern parts). Numerous small lakes are in the country. The occupations of the population are chiefly agricultural, and the flax and turnip crops have of late been extensively cultivated. Agricultural and cattle shows are annually held, under the patronage of the country gentry. Large quantities of butter and other farm produce are sent to the English market.
