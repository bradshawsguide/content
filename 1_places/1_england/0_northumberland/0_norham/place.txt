Text:

Here is a very old church and a border castle, the ruins of which are approached by means of a suspension bridge across the river. It is thus referred to by Sir Walter Scott, in his *Marmion:*--

> Day sets on Norham's castled steep,
> And Tweed's fair river, broad and deep,
> And Cheviot's mountains lone.

The tide flows to this point; *Twizel Castle*, seat of Sir F. Blake, Bart., on the on the "sullen Till," which falls in here, near the old Gothic bridge, which Surrey crossed on the way to Flodden Field.

> High sight it is and haughty, while
> They dive into the deep defile
> Beneath the castle's airy wall.

The present castle is modern.
