(smcp: Whitehaven).â€”A prosperous coal port, on the west coast of Cumberland, with a population of 18,842, who are engaged in the coal trade and herring fishery (and return one member), not older than two centuries; and seated under the white rocks at the mouth of the river Poe. Lord Lonsdale is the owner of the land around the town, which is modern, and regularly built of houses covered with slate. There are four churches, of which the oldest dates from 1694; it has a good organ, and the "Last Supper," by Reed. The town contains a theatre, library, baths, race stand, ship yard, battery, good harbour and quays, and a public library and news room, which was established in 1797. At *Whitehaven Castle*, the Earl's seat, there is a picture gallery. The coal measures form a thin strip round the coast past Workington an Maryport. The mines are worked by deep shafts a quarter of a mile down, close to the edge of *the sea*, under which they run than *two miles*, the dip of the beds being as much as 1 foot in 10. Some of them are 8 and 10 feet think with coal. When raised, the "black diamonds" are turned into the wagons, which descend the tram road by the own weight to the quay, and drag up the empty ones; here they are dropped through the wooden lurries into the vessel's hold. An artificial harbour, by Rennie has been constructed between two piers, 1,300 and 1,800 feet long. At the proper season the herring fisheries are very productive. In the American war is was attacked by Paul Jones (who was acquainted with the coast, from having been a cabin boy here); he landed, spiked the guns of the little fort, and set fire to two vessels in the hrbour, an act which certainly tells much of his daring courage, and the surprising weakness of the authorities.

Whitehaven to Keswick, on foot, by road, 28 miles. Passing *Weddicar*, *Arlecdon*, *Lamplugh*, to *Lowes Water*, a small lonely lake, under Blake Fell 12 miles. Lead and stone are found in the part. Up the side of *Crummock Water*, to *Buttermere*, 7 miles. On the west side of Crummock Lake which is rather grand, and well wooded at the foot, under Melbreak Fell, is a fine fall of 156 feet, called *Scale Force*. *Grisedale Pike*, to the north, 2,756 feet high. *Buttermere Church* is a curious small old structure. The Lake of *Buttermere* is surrounded by wild and elevated mountains, especially above its head, where Honistar Crag, 1,600 feet high, Red Pike, 2,850 feet, Great Gable, 2,925 feet, the Pillar, 2,893 feet, Glaramara, &c., are seen, backed by the Barrowdale Fells and Scafell, 3,166 feet, the highest peak of all. From Buttermere throug the quiet valley of Newlands, under Hindicar, Cawsey Pike, &c., to Kewick, 9 miles. With a guide you may find your way from Buttermere into Laugdale, on the road to Ambleside, about 20 miles, who is necessary, not so much for the difficulty of the path as for safety in case of sudden mists and changes in the weather. Along the coast from Whitehaven, on or near the railway is *Muncaster Hall*, the seat of Lord Muncaster. Here is Henry VI.'s cup, who took refuge here after the battle of Hexham, in 1464.
