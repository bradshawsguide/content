Three-quarters of a mile beyond Woking a line branches off to the left to Guildford and Godalming, direct to Portsmouth, from which another branch diverges at Guildford and extends to Ash, Farnham, and Alton.

## Goldalming to Portsmouth

This route is a continuation of the line *via* Guildford and Godalming to Portsmouth, bringing the latter place about 21 miles nearer London than by the old route, via Bishopstoke.--The stations are [Milford](/stations/milford-surrey), [Witney](/stations/witley), [Haslemere](/stations/haslemere), [Liphook](/stations/liphook), [Liss](/stations/liss).

[Petersfield](/stations/petersfield), a neat little town of great antiquity. It has a population of 5,655, and returns one member to parliament. Near the chapel there is an equestrian statue of William III, built by the Joliffes of Merstham.

(branch: start)
  To the left about 9 miles long runs though [Rogate](/stations/rogate) and [Elstead](/stations/elsted) to [Midhurst](/stations/midhurst), in the neighbourhood of which is *West Lavington Church*, a neat structure, of local stone, situated on the side of a hill, from whence a magnificent prospect may be obtained. No doubt it will long be revered as being the resting-place of the mortal remains of the late Richard Cobden, Esq. and his son. *Dunford*, the house in which the great free-trader was born, stood on the crest of a hill, in a little wooded glen, about a mile further south. It has since been rebuilt, and formed part of the gift presented to him by the country for his national services.

  It is intended, ultimately, to carry the line forward to Petworth, in connection with the Brighton system. The distance, at present, is traversed by coach.
