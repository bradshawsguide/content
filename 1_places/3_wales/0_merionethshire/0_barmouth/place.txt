It is a small manufacturing town, situated on the slope of a hill, with a considerable miscellaneous trade.

Ten miles up the coast is *Harlech*, with its historical old ruined castle, from which *Craig Ddrwg* and the *Rhinog Faur* (upwards of 2,000 feet high) may be climbed, with every yard full of Druidical and British remains.
