Text:

Upon issuing from the station at Birmingham the train proceeds on a curve past Duddeston, crosses the embankment over the Fazeley Canal and Lichfield road by a viaduct, which affords a fine view of the great manufacturing emporium we are leaving.

The line then continues past the suburban station of [Bloomsbury](/stations/bloomsbury), to

(place: england/warwickshire/aston)

To the right of this station short line runs *via* [Gravelley Hill](/stations/gravelley-hill), [Erdington](/stations/erdington), [Chester Road](/stations/chester-road), and [Wylde Green](/stations/wylde-green) to the village of [Sutton Coldfield](/stations/sutton-coldfield), a place of no very particular note, beyond an occasional pic-nic excursion.

The line immediately alter leaving Aston crosses the boundary of Warwickshire, and enters Staffordshire.

Passing several gentlemen's seats the line traverses a cutting in a fine open country, and soon reaches

(place: england/staffordshire/perry-barr)

On leaving Perry Bar and its handsome church, which is worth a visit, we pass through a cutting, and then over an iron bridge, which spans the Tame. This beautiful little river winds through the valley, and gives a very pretty picturesque view to the scenery.

[Hamstead](/stations/hamstead) is situated in a beautiful and luxuriant vale from which it takes its name, to the right of which is Hampstead Hall, on the banks of the Tame. The prospect from both sides of the line is particularly fine and exhilarating. Two miles distant is the Roman Catholic College at Oscott. The line then enters a cutting, upon emerging from which we observe *Sandwell Hall* and *Park*, the seat of the Earl of Dartmouth, and shortly after arrive at
