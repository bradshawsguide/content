title: Inverness-shire

text: This is one of the largest counties of Scotland, and returns one member. Its surface is in general extremely rugged and uneven, consisting of vast ranges of mountains, separated from each other by narrow and deep valleys. These mountains stretch across the whole country, from one end of the island to another, and lie parallel to every valley, rising like immense walls on both sides, while the intersected country sinks deep between them, with a lake, or rapid river, or an arm of the sea, following in the centre. No sooner is one defile passed over than a second range of hills comes into view, which contains another, and a strath of uninhabited country. The great Caledonian Glen, which runs in a straight line nearly north-east and south-west, divides the county into two almost equal parts. This valley, in the greater part of its length, is naturally filled with water, and forms a long chain of lakes succeeding each otherâ€”a circumstance which suggested the idea of transferring the whole into the Caledonian Canal.
