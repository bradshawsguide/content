Text:

Here are manufactures of shoes. The church contains an altar-piece, by Beechy, and monument to Earl St Vincent, born at Meaford Hall, in 1734. Junction of line to Norton Bridge. From Stone to the Potteries the scenery is scarcely less beautiful, including a view of the woods, &c., of Trentham (one of the seats of the Duke of Sutherland); Meaford Hall (Viscount St. Vincent's), &c.
