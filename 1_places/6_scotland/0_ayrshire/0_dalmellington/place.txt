text: Fifteen miles from Ayr, on the river Doon, in the  midst of a rich mineral country. Close by are an ancient earth-work and several cairns. *Loch Doon*, through which the river Doon runs, will well repay  a visit. It is six miles long by about one in breadth, and full of fine trout. On an island stands *Balloch Castle*, deserving notice, from the fact of its being built with freestone, and there being no quarry within eight miles, and the intervening distance rough, mountainous, and without a road.
