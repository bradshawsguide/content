Passing under the magnificent Doric entrance, which forms so grand a feature of the metropolitan terminus of this line of railway, the huge pile of building at once arrests the eye. It was designed by Philip Hardwick, Esq., and erected by Messrs. William Cubitt and Co., at a cost of about £50,000.

The structure, of the interior, is of plain Roman style of architecture, and is 220 feet long by 168 feet in width. At the southern front there are five entrances. The outer doors lead into what is called the "outer vestibule," having a beautifully designed mosaic pavement, constructed of patent metallic lead, within a border of Craigleith stone. On the northern side of the "outer vestibule" are five other entrances, leading into the grand hall or vestibule; and this hall for size and grandeur is probably unique; in dimensions it is truly gigantic, being 125 feet in length, 61 feet in width, and 60 feet in height. At the northern end is a noble flight of steps, leading to a vestibule, in which are doors entering into the general meeting room, the board room, and the conference room, and the gallery which runs round the hall, thus giving facility of communication to an infinity of offices connected with the railway traffic.

The style of architecture is Roman Ionic, and has been treated with great skill. The bas-reliefs which adorn the panels in the comers of the hall are eight in number, and typify the chief cities and boroughs with which the North Western Railway communicates. They are London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Carlisle, Chester, Lancaster, and Northampton. London is typified by a female figure, crowned, bearing in her hands the sceptre of royalty, and the rudder, emblem of maritime power. Below her sits an old man with a long beard, symbolical of Father Thames, and by her knees a genius, his arm resting on a globe, and at his feet emblems of music, painting, and the drama, indicating the universality of the art of knowledge of the great metropolis of the world. The background is filled with St. Paul's and a group of shipping. Liverpool is a sitting female figure, resting on a rudder, with a genius by her side holding a quadrant. An aged man, having shells and corals in his hair, symbolises the Mersey: in his right hand he holds a trident, and his left rests upon a well filled cornucopia. A portion of the Exchange and a group of shipping fills up this characteristic group. Manchester is individualised by a laurel-crowned female, sitting and holding a distaff, her hand resting on a bale of cotton; a genius by her side holding the shuttle, indicative of the cotton-spinning notoriety of the important city. Mercury, emblem of commerce, sits in the foreground, busy drawing plans on a piece of paper, and the background is composed of piles of cotton goods, a huge factory, and the tower of the cathedral. Birmingham has the symbols of the iron trade—Vulcan, with Iris hammer and anvil being in the foreground; a beautiful vase, showing the variety and perfection of the iron works, and the portico of the new Town Hall, fill up the group. Chester with its far-famed dairy produce, its cheeses, its walls, and venerable cathedral is well characterised. Carlisle shows cattle market, manufacture, and maritime symbols, with its cathedral tower; Lancaster its furniture and other manufactures; and Northampton has its emblems, the shoemaker, as well as agricultural symbols, and a horse to typify its celebrated horse fair.

The large group in alto-relievo over the door leading to the general meeting room, is an extremely picturesque and effective composition—representing Britannia, supported by Science and Industry. The statue of the late George Stephenson, who effected more than any other engine has done towards the development of the railway system, is a very appropriate ornament to the great hall. The statue, which is of fine Carrara marble, is ten feet in height The figure is habited in the costume of the times, and holds in the right hand a scroll, upon which is inscribed the elevation of an aqueduct.

Leading from the grand hall on the basement, on the eastern and western sides are several glass doors, connecting it with the booking offices and platforms.
