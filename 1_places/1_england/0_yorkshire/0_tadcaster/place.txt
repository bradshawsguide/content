Text: The Roman name of this place was *Calcaria* (Calx). It is a market town, and has a long stone bridge having little water under it, whence the epigram, "magnificè structum sine flumine pontem." Bishop Oglethorpe's Grammar School and Hospital, and a later English Church. Limestone abounds in the vicinity, and of which York Minster is built.
