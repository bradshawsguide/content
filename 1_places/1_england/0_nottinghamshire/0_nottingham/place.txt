(smcp: Nottingham), the Saxon *Snatinghaham*, and capital of the county of Notts, near the beautiful river Trent, well known to the angler, is situated on a rocky eminence of red sandstone, and is allowed by competent judges to be not only one of the healthiest, but one of the most picturesque inland towns in England. At a height of 300 feet above the level of the town towers Castle Hill, from which a noble prospect of the town, and a vast extent of country maybe obtained. Up to a recent date Nottingham, though well built, paved, and so forth, has been excessively crowded, from the circumstance that the town limits were strained to the utmost, so that persons connected with its trade were obliged to resort to the neighbouring parishes, where populous villages have sprung up, as at Radford, Lenton, Basford, Carrington, Arnold, Sneinton, Carlton, &c., at the latter of which is to be found the largest quantity of the purest red clay in the world, so that a very extensive trade is carried on in the making of bricks, &c.

The town is now rapidly increasing, and bids fair to rank amongst the first manufacturing towns in England, some warehouses of great architectural beauty having already made their appearance.

About a mile from the Exchange on the Mansfield Road is a beautiful Arboretum, which, together with the delightful walks off that road, and others adjoining the Queen's Road, and that leading to the banks of the Trent, crossed by means of a ferry boat to the Clifton side (whose beautiful grove is frequented by all the admirers of nature) and the subject of Kirke White's muse, form pleasant sources of recreation and enjoyment. The total population of the borough is upwards of 74,693, but the industrial population in and around Nottingham, and dependent upon its trade, is nearly three times that number. Silk, cotton stockings, and bobbin-net lace are the staple manufactures. Until recently the stockings were usually worked upon frames, rented from the employers; but this, to a great extent, has been altered since the introduction of the round frames, which are now generally confined to factories. Hand and power machines are used for the net, which, succeeding Lindley's point net (used first in 1780), was invented by Heathcote in 1809. Arkwright set up here (before 1771) one of his earliest spinning machines; it was moved by horse-power. It was on the occasion of the distress among the frame-work knitters and twist hands here that Lord Byron delivered his two speeches in Parliament, in 1812, which are usually to be found in his works. This was just after the publication of his "English Bards and Scotch Reviewers." One of the wards of Nottingham is named Byron ward, and another Sherwood ward, that forest being only a few miles distant.

In 1917 the frame-work knitters and twist hands broke out again, under the name of Luddites, and went about destroying machinery, &c. The Market Place is one of the finest in England, and stands on an area of upwards of five acres of land, well pared, &c., at one end of which stands the *Exchange*. Here will be found most of the principal shops in the town. The second floors of these houses hang over the pavement, supported by large pillars, and form an elegant piazza. The *Corn Exchange*, in Thurland Street, 77 feet long by 50 broad, has a glass roof, and was built in 1850. The *Mechanics' Institution*, in Milton street, at the bottom of Mansfield Road, is a fine building of modern date. The *Assembly Rooms*, in the Low Pavement, the exterior of which lays claim to no great pretensions, as to its interior may be found worthy of notice. The *County Hall*, on a rock near the High Pavement, was built in 1770, by J. Gandon the architect of the Custom House, and other first class buildings in Dublin: behind it is the *County Prison*. The *Town Hall*, in the Middle Pavement, where the sessions and assizes are held for the town. The town *House of Correction* is at the bottom of Lower Parliament Street, and stands on the site of an ancient Preceptory of the order of Knights Hospitallers.

*St. Mary's* church is an ancient building, on a rock, shaped like a cross, and having a pinnacled tower of later date. There is a chapel (formerly a chantry) in it to the memory of J. Plumtre, who in 1392, founded an hospital here, lately rebuilt. *St. Peter's* church has a crochetted spire, and is partly Norman. *Trinity* is modern Gothic, with a spire. Pugin's Romish *Cathedral* is also in the Gothic style, 180 feet long, with a tall spire. The painted windows were the gift of the late Earl of Shrewsbury. The *General Hospital* was founded in 17S1. The *County Asylum* occupies a site of 8 acres. The new *Blind Asylum*, for the Midland counties, by Messrs. Aickin and Capes, is in the Elizabethan style. The *Forest Cemetery* is in the outskirts. The Lene is converted into an unhealthy marsh on the south side of the town, and after dividing into several branches, joins the Trent at the long straggling bridge or causeway of 19 arches, which replaces one made by Edward the elder, who first fortified Nottingham.

The *Castle* was built by the Conqueror's nephew, William Peverell, to command the Trent, and after various events, dismantled by Cromwell, in common with other feudal places in England. A mansion, erected on the site, by the Duke of Newcastle, in 1680, was burnt down in the riots of 1831, on account of the part taken by the late Duke against the Reform Bill, for which he obtained £21,000 damages from the hundred. After Richard II's death, his worthless queen, Isabella, came here to live with her favourite, Roger Mortimer, where they were betrayed by Sir Wm. Eland, the Governor, to Edward III., who found an entrance from below by a secret passage from the rock, still called *Mortimer's Hole*; Mortimer was executed, and Isabella banished. In 1642, Charles I. occupied it, and first hoisted his tag against the parliament, on a hill in the Park, since called Standard Hill, close to the former cavalry barracks. But the royalist party only kept possession of it till the next year, when Colonel Hutchinson was appointed Governor of the Castle on behalf of parliament. Mrs. Hutchinson, in her delightful Memoirs, describes the Castle and the stirring events in which her husband took a leading part; among others of the temporary surprise of the town by the Newark cavaliers, through the treachery of Alderman Toplady, a great malignant, and how they were hindered from pursuing them, when driven out, by the obstinacy of an "old dull-headed Dutchman." On this occasion, the former church of *St. Nicholas*, was pulled down, because its steeple commanded the platform of the Castle. Colonel Hutchinson was born here in 1616, his father being obliged to remove from Owithorpe to winter here just at that time; his mother was a Byron of Newstead. Another native was Henry Kirke White, born in 1785, a butcher's son. He was first brought up at Mr. Blauchard's School, and after a year's application at a stocking loom, was apprenticed to Messrs. Coldham and Enfield, solicitors here, and studied so hard that he was chosen Professor of Literature in the Literary Society, by acclamation, when only 15 years old. The hopes excited by his earliest poems (published three years after), were nipped by a sharp notice in a review, but they led to his acquaintance with Southey, the publication of his "Remains," and his posthumous celebrity. Southey says that Coleridge was present when he opened White's papers after his death, and both were astonished at the industry and ability they displayed. Besides papers on literature, science, poems, tragedies, and political articles, he had planned a history of Nottingham. "I have inspected (says the generous biographer) all the existing MSS. of Chatterton, and they excited less wonder than these. On *Mapperley Plain*, an elevated spot to the north, there is a prospect of Belvoir Castle and Lincoln Cathedral. Here it is intended to erect the Midland Observatory, founded in 1853, chiefly by the liberality of Mr. Lawson, of Bath, who gave instruments to the institution, together with £10,000. At Mr. Lowe's Observatory, *Highfield House*, a temperature of 6° below zero (38 below freezing point) was noted on the 3rd January, 1854, being lower than anything that had happened for 85 years past.

In the neighbourhood are caves in the Park and in the cliffs at Sneinton; those in the town are used as wine vaults, &c. *Colick* (2 miles), was the seat of the late J. Musters, Esq., who married Miss Chaworth, Byron's first love when he was a young boy, and she two years older. He appears, however, never to have forgotten her. "Our union would have healed feuds in which blood had been shed by our fathers," in which blood had been shed by our fathers," alluding to the unfortunate duel in which his uncle the former peer, killed a Mr. Chaworth in a drunken squabble, for which he was tried and acquitted. *Woolaton* (3 miles), among coal mines, is the seat of Lord Middleton, a remarkably handsome specimen of an Elizabethan mansion, built in 1508. Among the family portraits is Sir Hugh Willoughby, the navigator, who was frozen to death in the White Sea. At *Clifton* (3 miles), the ancient seat of Sir J. Clifton, Bart., and his family for many generations, are the Groves, described in K. White's longest poem; the old church and the churchyard were his favourite haunts. *Bunny Park*, Lord Rancliffe, belonged to Sir T. Parkyns, who was so fond of wrestling that, besides writing an erudite treatise on the "Cornish Hug," he left an annual bequest of a guinea for its encouragement. *Foremarks*, on the Derbyshire side, wits the seat of that weak but amiable politician, Sir F. Burdett. His youngest daughter, Miss Burdett Coutts, so fruitful in good works, is the well known heiress of the late Duchess of St. Albans, *nee* Miss Mellon, the actress, the second wife of the *millionaire*, the late Mr. Coutts, the banker. Tollerton (4 miles), P. Barry, Esq. *Gotham* (8 miles), an old place famous for its wise men, rivals even to the men of Coggeshall, in Essex. The men of Gotham are, however, said to have been the first to find a mare's nest.
