(smcp: Ashby-de-la-Zouch), in Leicestershire, a thriving manufacturing town of 3,772 population, where stockings, hats, and fire bricks are made, and iron smelted, is situated in the middle of a coal field of 100 square miles. The coal is a shining hard sort. A bath-house has been built over some valuable springs which rise from the pits, and are very beneficial in cases of scrofula and similar complaints. Bishop Hall, one of the most famous divines of the English church, was born here in 1574, and brought up at the Grammar School, of which he became master. Formerly the town belonged to the Zouches, and was named after them--now it is the property of the Hastings family. Their castle here was built in 1480 in the Tudor style, by Sir William Hastings, who had the misfortune to be beheaded in the Tower by Richard III. As master of the mint to Edward IV., he was the first to coin nobles, worth 8s. 4d. each. This castle was one of the prisons of poor Mary, Queen of Scots; and being dismantled in the civil war, only the chapel, tower, &c., of the original pile remain. A front of later date has been added. In the old church, among the family tombs, is that of the excellent Countess of Huntingdon, one of Wesley's earliest and most steadfast adherents, from whom the present Marquis is descended.

Near Ashby is *Coleorton Hall*, seat of Sir G. Beaumont, Bart. *Willesley Park*, to the rest, belongs to Sir C. Hastings, Bart.
