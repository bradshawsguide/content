Text:

This town is situated in a pleasant valley on the river Wiley, with a population of 1,103, chiefly employed in the woollen manufacture. Here Queen Maude lived. In the ancient church (rebuilt in 1404) Cunningham, the antiquary, is buried. Close by is *Heytesbury House*, the seat of Lord Heytesbury. In the vicinity are more remains of our rude forefathers, in the shape of barrows, camps, entrenchments, and other earthworks, evidently occupied by Britons, Romans, Saxons, and Danes in succession. *Knock Castle*, 3 miles east, a more remarkable one than all.
