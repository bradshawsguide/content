Text: It contains an ancient church, with tomb of Section e, of Park Hall; several mills, foundries, bleach and print works. In the vicinity are *Glossop Hall*, seat of Lord Edward Howard. Within a short distance, a Roman road, popularly called the Doctor's Gate, leads into the Roman Station, now called *Melandra Castle*, situated on an eminence near the confluence of two mountain streams. The ramparts, ditch, prætorium, and foundations of buildings, fill the beholder with gloomy but pleasurable feelings.
