text: The first stations being [Beddington](/stations/beddington-lane) and [Mitcham](/stations/mitcham), both on the river Wandle. The church of the latter is worth a visit. We then approach the station of [Morden](/stations/morden), near which is *Merton*, possessing much historical interest. Here are the remains of a rich abbey founded for St. Augustine Canons; and here Ethelred I. was defeated by the Danes, 871, and received his death wound. Here were enacted "the provisions of Merton," in the reign of Henry III.; and here the glorious Nelson lived. The church is partly of Norman, and partly of the early English styles. *Morden Park*, ½ mile.
