A charming spot in the valley of the *Erme*, much frequented in summer. The hills (1,100 feet high at one point) here begin to ascend towards *Dartmoor* which lies to the north-west. It is a desolate tract of granite moorland, 20 miles long by 12 broad, once a forest, but now covered with peat. Copper and tin are worked. Some of its rugged peaks, here called tors, are 1,200 to 2,000 feet high; and under one is the Dartmoor *Convict Prison*. The Dart rises at Cranmere; on account of its striking scenery and fishing, it should be descended all the way to the fine port of Dartmouth.
