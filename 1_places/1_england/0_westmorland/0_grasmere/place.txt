Good and cheap lodgings may be obtained. The town itself being on the side of a hill commands views of the beautiful valley beneath, Windermere, Rydal Park, &c. Formerly it was a Roman station, and possesses, therefore, claims to great antiquity; but everything about it has a modern appearance. The church was built in 1852.
