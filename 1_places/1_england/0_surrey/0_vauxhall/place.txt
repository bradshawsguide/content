Looking down upon the faded beauties of the once-called "Royal Property"--Vauxhall Gardens, and by the extensive depots of the company at Nine Elms over the mill pond, on to an embankment from which we can catch a few glimpses of the Belgravian shore, and Cubit's factories and church to the right, and, if the haze and smoke permit, the lofty campanile of the Houses of Parliament.
