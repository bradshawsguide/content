[Greenhill Junction](/stations/greenhill-junction).--Trains from Glasgow and the south unite here with this line, beyond which circumstance the station possesses no extraordinary attraction.

(place: scotland/stirlingshire/larbert)

To facilitate the traffic to and from Edinburgh and the north, a short branch line turns off here, running into the Edinburgh and Glasgow railway at Polmont.

Another branch taking a north-easterly direction runs via [Airth](/stations/airth) to [South Alloa](/stations/south-alloa).

At [Falkirk](/stations/grahamston-falkirk), a telegraph station, midway between Larbert and Polmont, a line turns off to the left for [Grangemouth](/stations/grangemouth), a bonding town of importance for shipping, on the Firth of Forth, and telegraph station.
