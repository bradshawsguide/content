In the neighbourhood are *Deptford Inn* (½ mile), *Fisherton de la Mére* (1 mile). *Yarmbury Castle* (2 miles), a most interesting earthen work or fortification, occupying an elevated situation above the plain. *Badbury Camp* (1 mile), supposed to be the *Mons Badonicus* of the Romans, and the *Baddiebrig* of the Saxons. Here Arthur defeated Cedric, in 520. The decayed town of *Hindon*, 6 miles west, near which is *Fonthill Abbey*, Alfred Morrison, Esq., but formerly the seat of Beckford, the author of that most original Eastern story, "Caliph Vathek," and who lived here in the most selfish retirement. It has the appearance of a vast monastic edifice, crowned by a lofty tower, visible at the distance of 40 miles, and commands views over beautifully picturesque and abundantly diversified scenery. He died and was buried at Bath.
