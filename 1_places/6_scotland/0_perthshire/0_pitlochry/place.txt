text: This place is important as affording facilities to the tourist for visiting the beautiful *Pass of Killicrankie*,  the spot where Claverhouse fell in 1869. It is a deep ravine, clothed with the richest verdure, through the centre of which the Garry water flows. It is about four miles north-west of this place, a little above the confluence of the rivers Tummel and Garry.
