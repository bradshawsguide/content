Proceeding thense, we come to [Sutton](/stations/sutton), 1½ mile from which is the *Oaks*, giving its name to the race, the seat of the Earl of Derby.

A short line of railway runs hence by [California](/stations/california), across *Banstead Downs*, a range of hills commanding some very pretty and extensive scenery, at the foot of which is the station of [Banstead](/stations/banstead). It extends to [Epsom Downs](/stations/epsom-downs), in the immediate neighbourhood of the Race Course.
