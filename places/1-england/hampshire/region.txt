country: England
----
text: One of the southern counties of England, bounded on the east by Surrey and Sussex; on the south by the English Channel; and on the west by Wiltshire and Dorsetshire. It extends in length, from north to south, about fifty-five miles; in breadth from east to west, about forty. The surface of Hampshire is beautifully varied with gently rising hills, fruitful valleys, and extensive woodlands. The chief part of the country is enclosed, though large tracts of open heath and uncultivated lands remain, especially in that part which borders Dorsetshire. The manufactures of Hampshire are not considerable; the principle are those of woolen goods. Great quantities of excellent malt and made at Andover; malt and leather at Basingstoke, and also silk, straw hats and paper; vast quantities of common salt and of Epsom and Glauber salts, at Lymington; and in the neighbourhood of Redbridge there are valuable salt marshes. The minerals of Hampshire are scarcely deserving of notice, though the chalk strata and the rocks along the coast present very interesting objects for the geologist. Hampshire is much resorted to the purpose of sea-bathing, and also as a fashionable summer residence, and bathing houses have, in consequence, been erected all along the coast. The scenery of the New Forest is particularly admired, and the whole country abounds with villas and country seats.

The railway communication of the county is supplied principally by the South Western Railway Company, from Farnborough Station to Winchester, Southampton, Portsmouth, Sailsbury, &c., &c., and the Great Western have a branch line between Reading and Basingstoke.
