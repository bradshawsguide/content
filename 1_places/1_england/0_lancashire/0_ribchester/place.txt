text: "This is the Roman *Colcium*, where the 20th legion were stationed, and a bronze helmet, mask, pateræ, inscriptions, coins, anchors, and a vessel's hull, were found in 1796, so that the sea must have come up to this place in ancient times. Near the camp is *St. Wilfred's* Church, which had formerly two chantreys."—Sharp's <cite>British Gazetteer</cite>.
