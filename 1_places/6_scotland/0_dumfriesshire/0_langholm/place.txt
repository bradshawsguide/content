Text: Situated on the river Esk, here crossed by a bridge. The river furnishes good fishing. The place is supplied with the usual buildings of a chartered town, and its population principally weavers. The country around is of a hilly but fertile character. Traces of Border towers, and some Roman coins, have been found.
