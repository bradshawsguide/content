Text:

This station is most exquisitely situated amidst the charming scenery of the New Forest. In the churchyard are some very large yew and oak trees. The Rev. William Gilpin, the author of "Forest Scenery," &c., &c., founded two schools here, and endowed them with the profits arising out of the sale of a part of his writings, &c. Some of these realised as much as £1,200, in the year 1802, and subsequently, after his death, another lot fetched as much as £1,500. He lies buried in Boldre churchyard.
