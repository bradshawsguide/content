(place: england/buckinghamshire/high-wycombe)

The line continues hence through [West Wycombe](/stations/high-wycombe), the old market town of [Princes Risborough](/stations/princess-risborough), from whence there is a continuation of the line to Aylesbury. Leaving Princes Risborough, the line takes a westerly curve through [Bledlow](/stations/bledlow), and, immediately leaving the county of Bucks, enters that of Oxford, and very soon after arrives at

[Thame](/stations/thame), a small market town, consisting of one long street. The church is very old, and built in the form of a cross, has a fine tower, and its windows of stained glass.

[Wheatley](/stations/wheatley) and [Littlemore](/stations/littlemore), the latter of which has a very considerable pile of buildings used as a Pauper Lunatic Asylum.
