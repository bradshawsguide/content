text: One of the Southern Counties, is varied by the inequalities of the Downs and by intervening valleys to which the wooded scenery and pasture land give a rural and a rich diversity of appearance. It belongs to the chalk, formation, and has some high ranges of clowns and hills. The north is occupied by Wealden formation, covering 420,000 acres, and the south by the chalk formation. On the east are marshes and alluvial lands, and on the west coast it is much indented by, at others it runs out into, bold cliffs.

This county is celebrated for its treed of sheep, which are fed on the South Downs, the name by which they are distinguished. This, and the adjoining counties of Hants and Surrey, were by the Romans denominated Belgae, from the circumstance of their being inhabited by a people called Belgians, who supplanted the British Celts.

The railway communication of the county of Sussex is supplied by the [London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company](/companies/london-brighton-and-south-coast). The London and Brighton main line, commencing at the London Bridge Terminus, proceeds past Sydenham and Croydon to Reigate, thence enters the county of Sussex at Crawley, and passes due South to Brighton, having branch lines extending along the coast to Lewes and Hastings, and Newhaven to the north, and to Shoreham, Worthing, Arundel, Chichester, Havant, and Portsmouth on the south.
