Text:

A walk of a mile from Timperley brings us to Altrincham, and a quarter of a mile further, to Bowdon, and here the traveller would do well to spend a few hours.

(place: england/cheshire/altrincham-and-bowden)

We now retrace our steps to [Timperley](/stations/timperley) on our way to Manchester, passing [Brooklands](/stations/brooklands), [Sale](/stations/sale), and [Stretford](/stations/stretford), to [Old Trafford](/stations/old-trafford), in the vicinity of which is *Trafford Park*, seat of Sir Humphrey De Trafford, Bart., descended from one of the most ancient of all the old families in this county. The park is extensive, but rather bare; the hall of plain brick. [Knott Mill](/stations/knott-mill) station.
