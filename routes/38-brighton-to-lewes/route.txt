text: The Preston viaduct of this short line is a magnificent structure, consisting of an elliptic arch 50 feet span, and 73 feet high, flanked on one side by 18, and on the other by 9 semicircular arches, 30 feet span; the former arc built on a curve of three-quarters of a mile radius, and the latter on a 10 chain radius. The length of the viaduct is 400 yards, and ten millions of bricks were used in the construction. In consequence of its being on the curve, one side is above 40 feet longer than the other; all the arcades radiate towards the centre of the curve, and the piers are one foot eight inches thicker at one end than the other, in order to render the openings parallel. The viaduct is universally admired for its beautiful proportions. The view from its summit is exceedingly fine. On the elevated ground to the right is the extensive terminus of the Brighton Railway, and in front lies the town of Brighton and its fine expanse of sea.

After crossing the above viaduct, the line passes through a short tunnel (sixty yards) beneath the Ditchling Road, and the deep chalk cuttings on either side. Just beyond the cutting a bridge crosses the road, forming the northern boundary of the parish of Brighton. After passing through another cutting of considerable length and depth, the line extends along the side of the hill at the back of the Cavalry Barracks, and consists of embankment and cutting combined. Another cutting brings us to Moulscombe, a neat villa, the grounds of which are bisected by the railway, and again connected by a bridge. A deep cutting leads us to Hodshrove, where the Lewes turnpike road is crossed by a skew-bridge of three arches, which are of noble proportions and of massive strength. From this point, the line which had hitherto run on the western side of the Lewes road, lies entirely on the eastern side. A high embankment and deep cutting follow; and we then pass another long one skirting the front of the Earl of Chichester's Park at Stanmer. This is the most beautiful domain on the line; the estate comprehends the whole parish and village of Stanmer, including the church. The park occupies a valley formed by one of those bold ranges of hills which adorn the coasts of this county; and its undulating surface, varied by thick masses of foliage, forms a rich contrast to the open downs by which it is environed. The Stanmer elevation brings us to the foot of

A deep cutting commences here, which is succeeded by a tunnel, followed by another deep cutting; then a shorter one, and we obtain a sight of Lewes, St. Anne's Church and the Castle being the most prominent objects. Nothing remarkable occurs after this till we reach the foot of Water Shoot Hill, where the railway crosses the Winterbourne, and taking a course to the right by a short tunnel enters Southover, passing under the road which leads from Lewes to Newhaven. It then crosses the priory grounds, and thus arrives at the station at

which is in High Street, at the foot of School Hill.
