The principal part of Thetford is in Norfolk, but a small part is in Suffolk. The part which is situated in tho latter county is now very small; but on the Norfolk side there are several good streets, and of late years the town has much improved in its general appearance. Remains of its former splendour are noticeable. King's or John of Gaunt's Palace, remains of Bigod's Priory, where several noble families were interred, St. Sepulchre's Gate, Chapel of Canute's Nunnery, St. Peter's dark flint Church, the Guildhall, and Castle Hall, 100 feet high, should be visited.
