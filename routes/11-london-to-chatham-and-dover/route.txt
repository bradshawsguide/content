text: This company has now two termini in London; both conveniently situated to accommodate pleasure and business traffic. The West End terminus is a portion of the extensive Victoria station, Pimlico, whilst the City station is at Farringdon Street, where it unites with the Metropolitan or under-ground railway to King's Cross and Paddington. This section of the line, under the name of [the Metropolitan Extension](/routes/farringdon-street-to-herne-hill), joins with that of the Western at Herne Hill, and has become very much crowded with local traffic.

Leaving [Victoria](/stations/victoria), we almost immediately cross the Thames, pass [Battersea Park](/stations/battersea-park), and arrive at [Stewart's Lane](/stations/stewarts-lane), at which are situate extensive works belonging to the company. From thence we pass [Wandsworth Road](/stations/wandsworth-road), [Clapham](/stations/clapham), and [Brixton](/stations/brixton) to [Herne Hill](/stations/herne-hill), the point of connection with the City or eastern section of the line, from whence we proceed over a viaduct of 30 arches, 1,000 feet in extent, and which has from a distance a very picturesque appearance, Beyond this is an embankment of a mile and a quarter, in the middle of which is Dulwich station. Following the embankment is a cutting of one third of a mile in extent, with slopes of 4 to 1, This brings us when at the depth of 60 feet, to the tunnel under Sydenham hill, and at the face of which there is now erected a station for the accommodation of the neighbourhood. Immediately beyond the tunnel, the line passes under nine lines of railway belonging to the [South Eastern](/companies/south-eastern) and [Brighton](/companies/london-brighton-and-south-coast) Companies. We next come to a small cutting which brings us to

[Penge](/stations/penge), and an embankment, similar in character to the one already mentioned, brings us to [Beckenham](/stations/beckenham). We next pass the station of [Shortlands](/stations/shortlands), and at the distance of three quarters of a mile further, arrive at

[Bickley](/stations/bickley) and [St. Mary's Cray](/stations/st-marys-cray) stations.

[Farningham](/stations/farningham).--Lullingstone and Eynesford Castles in the neighbourhood.

[Meopham](/stations/meopham) and [Sole Street](/stations/sole-street) are then passed; and at a distance of six mules beyond, the arrival of the train is announced at [Strood](/stations/strood) (the North Kent junction), which, together with [Rochester](/stations/rochester) and [Chatham](/stations/chatham), have just before been described.

[New Brompton](/stations/new-brompton) station.

A distance of 15 miles brings us through the little villages of [Bekesbourne](/stations/bekesbourne), [Adisham](/stations/adisham) (the station for Wingham), [Shepherd's Well](/stations/shepherds-well), and [Ewell](/stations/temple-ewell) to
