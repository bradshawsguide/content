Text: Is a place where a Christian church was founded as far back as 627, by Paulinus, archbishop of York, and has a large and ancient Collegiate Church or Minster, 306 feet long. The nave is Norman, with great massive pillars, and the rest is early English. The west towers, choir, beautiful screen, monuments of Archbishop Sandys and other York primates, Schmidt's *old* organ, as well as the brass reading desk, with an eagle brought from Newstead Lake, from which it as fished up, with the abbey papers hid inside, deserve notice. Over the belfry door is a very ancient piece of sculpture, supposed to refer to Christ. The chapter house, some parts of the archbishop's palace, and college, yet remain; the bounds of the Prebendage are marked by an old auclury, with an empty niche on the crown. One of the mineral springs in the neighbourhood gave the town its modern name; Bede calls it *Tisfulfingaceaster*--where the termination seems to point to the Roman state of *ad Pontem*, which was near. The *Saracen's Head*, here, is memorable in English History, as being the house where Charles I. surrendered himself in 1646 to his Scottish adherents, to be afterwards sold by them to Cromwell; his room is on the south side of the gate. It was then called the King's Arms. There are some remains of *Wolsey's Palace*, which Cromwell's troopers destroyed. A public walk is near *Norwood Hall*, the seat of SirJohn Sutton, Bart.
