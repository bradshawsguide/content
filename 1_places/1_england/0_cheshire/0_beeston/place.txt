text: Here are the ruins of an old castle, built by R Blundell, Earl of Chester, in 1220. It stands on the ridge of a precipitous rock of sandstone, and covers a space of about five acres. The deep ditch surrounding the keep, cut out of the solid rock, together with the extraordinary thickness of the walls which remain, bear testimony to the once-remarkable strength of the fortress. It is worth a visit.

In the vicinity are Tarporley Hall, Lord Alvanley and Tilstone Lodge, T. Tollemache, Esq.
