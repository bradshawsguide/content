Text: 1½ mile (across the suspension bridge, a ford for vehicles,) is *Mertown*, the seat of Lord Polwarth, head of all the Scotts. Here Sir Walter Scott wrote several of his works (amongst others "Marmion"), and G. P. R. James, the prolific novelist, obtained the materials for his historical romances. To the left of Maston are Lilliard's Edge, *Ancrum Moor*, There Archibald "Bell the Cat" defeated the English in 1544; *Mount Teviot*, seat of the Marquis of Lothian, close to the Waterloo pillar, from which can be seen Teviotdale and Jedburgh, with its antique abbey church. Not far distant is St. Bosells, celebrated for its large July cattle fair. The nest station is that of *St. Boswells*, l mile from the town of that name, the junction with the main line from Carlisle and Newcastle to the North. See page 100.
