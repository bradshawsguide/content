Text: (smcp: Gateshead), is a borough town (population, 33,587, who return one member), connected with Newcastle by a stone bridge over the Tyne river, and is a place of considerable antiquity. It has an old cross church, and excellent stone for grindstones at Gateshead Fell, where the cliffs rise to a great height above the river. The town originally consisted of one long street, which was built on the declivity of a steep hill that leads down to the bridge. Several modern improvements, however, have taken place, one of the most prominent of which is the erection of a handsome street in a curved line, to avoid the danger of the descent. The inhabitants are employed in manufacturing cast and wrought iron, &c., but from its proximity to Newcastle, the trade is less extensive than might be expected from the advantages of its situation.
