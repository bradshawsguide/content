Situated on the side of a hill, the top of which is surmounted by a circular keep and parts of walls, one of which is 12 feet in thickness, the remains of a very old castle, once the residence of the Dukes of Cornwall. Its origin seems to have been coeval with that of the early Britons. The church is a fine granite structure, covered with figures cut in the stone.
