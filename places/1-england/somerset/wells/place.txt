text: This ancient city is prettily situated in a valley at the foot of the Mendip hills, and has a population of 4,648. Conjointly with Bath it forms the see of a bishop, and returns two members to Parliament. Its cathedral ranks amongst the most important, and presents one of the most splendid specimens of Gothic architecture in England.
