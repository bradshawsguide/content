Text:

Newhaven, formerly a very obscure port or fishing town at the mouth of the river Ouse, is now a rising place, and become of some importance, as the port of communication between London, Dieppe, and Paris. Louis Philippe landed here in 1848, after his flight from France.

Three miles distant is *Seaford*, one of the Cinque Ports, and was formerly the port where the river Ouse emptied itself into the sea; but it was ruined in the year 1570, when a storm diverted the mouth of the river. The church is ancient, and there are traces of a Roman camp still visible in the neighbourhood.
