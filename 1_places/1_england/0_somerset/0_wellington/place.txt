Text:

Here is a Gothic church of which W. S. Salkeld was rector in James I.'s time. The Duke of Wellington, who derives his title from this place, is lord of the manor. A pillar, in honour of the Hero of Waterloo, was erected on Blackdown Hill. This range of hills is on the Devonshire borders, and produces stone used by scythe grinders, &c.
