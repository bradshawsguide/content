text: This place is situated on the river Mole, here crossed by a bridge of fourteen arches. The church was built about the year 1346, in the form of a cross, but has since been restored. The Mole here-abouts is very attractive to the pedestrian, as well the angler, for its excellent views and very excellent trout. *Fetcham Park* is close by.

An excursion maybe made from here to *Stoke d'Abernon* (3Â½ miles), passing through Woodlands Park, the seat of J. Smith, Esq. The old church (St. Mary's), at Stoke d'Abernon (or Alborne), lies embedded in trees, close to the Manor House (Rev. F. Parr Phillips). It contains the most ancient monumental brasses in England, and is much resorted to by antiquarians. The two most celebrated brasses to the D'Abernon family are in the chancel. The church also contains a curious hour-glass and stand, and is otherwise interesting. The key is at the Manor House.
