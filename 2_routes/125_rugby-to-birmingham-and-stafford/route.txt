text: Upon leaving the station the line proceeds along an embankment which affords a very pleasing prospect of the valley on the right, in which the Swift and several other small rivers unite their waters to form the Avon. Newbold-upon-Avon appears prettily situated on the opposite side of the valley, and across the fields on the left is *Bilton*, where Addison spent the evening of his life.

Five miles from Rugby the line reaches the [Brandon](/stations/brandon) embankment which is two miles in length, and affords some beautiful prospects.

It then crosses the Avon by a noble viaduct, and for a time the river gives a highly picturesque character to the scenery on the left.

After passing through a cutting we enter a wide extent of open country, and catch the first glimpse of the magnificent Coventry spires. From the embankment along which we proceed we can also see on the right, Stoke, Ernsford, Grange, Bromley, and the woods surrounding Coombc Abbey. The line crosses the Sowe by a beautiful viaduct of seven arches, and soon after the spires of Coventry rise distinctly above the intervening woods. We pass Whitley Abbey, which stands conspicuously on the left, cross a seven-arched viaduct over the Sherbourne Valley, enter a deep cutting, and shortly after we reach the station at

## Coventry to Birmingham

On leaving Coventry the line passes through several cuttings, in the openings of which a fine view may be obtained of the city, with its lofty spires, rising majestically from the dense mass of houses. The line continues through several cuttings, which exclude nearly all view of the country.

## Birmingham to Wolverhampton (via Bescot)

Upon issuing from the station at Birmingham the train proceeds on a curve past Duddeston, crosses the embankment over the Fazeley Canal and Lichfield road by a viaduct, which affords a fine view of the great manufacturing emporium we are leaving.

The line then continues past the suburban station of [Bloomsbury](/stations/bloomsbury), to

(place: england/warwickshire/aston)

To the right of this station short line runs *via* [Gravelley Hill](/stations/gravelley-hill), [Erdington](/stations/erdington), [Chester Road](/stations/chester-road), and [Wylde Green](/stations/wylde-green) to the village of [Sutton Coldfield](/stations/sutton-coldfield), a place of no very particular note, beyond an occasional pic-nic excursion.

The line immediately alter leaving Aston crosses the boundary of Warwickshire, and enters Staffordshire.

Passing several gentlemen's seats the line traverses a cutting in a fine open country, and soon reaches

(place: england/staffordshire/perry-barr)

On leaving Perry Bar and its handsome church, which is worth a visit, we pass through a cutting, and then over an iron bridge, which spans the Tame. This beautiful little river winds through the valley, and gives a very pretty picturesque view to the scenery.

[Hamstead](/stations/hamstead) is situated in a beautiful and luxuriant vale from which it takes its name, to the right of which is Hampstead Hall, on the banks of the Tame. The prospect from both sides of the line is particularly fine and exhilarating. Two miles distant is the Roman Catholic College at Oscott. The line then enters a cutting, upon emerging from which we observe *Sandwell Hall* and *Park*, the seat of the Earl of Dartmouth, and shortly after arrive at
