text: <span class="smcp">Droitwich</span> is built on the banks of the river Salwarpe. It possesses a canal six miles in length, and capable of admitting vessels of 600 tons burden, and communicates with the river Severn. Its principal manufacture is that of fine salt, which is obtained by evaporating the water of brine springs which are more than 100 feet below the surface of the earth.

In the vicinity a little to our right is *Westwood Park*; the fine old Elizabethan seat of Sir J. Pakington, Bart., fourth in descent (by the mother's side) from Sir Herbert Pakington, the "Sir Roger de Coverley" of Addison; also about a mile beyond *Ombersley Park* belonging to Lord Sandys, a descendant of Sandys, the poet, and Archbishop Sandys; it contains many old portraits.
