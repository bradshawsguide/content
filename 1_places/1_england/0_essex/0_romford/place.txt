Text: The town, which was the Roman *Durolitum*, contains a population of 4,361; the church, built in 1407 contained a stained figure of the Confessor, with effigies of Hervey and Sir Anthony Cooke (who entertained Queen Elizabeth at his seat, *Gidea Hall*, now occupied by Mrs. Blake), which was pulled down and a new one erected on its site in 1850, with a spire 150 feet high; Quarles, the poet, and his son, the royalist, were natives. In the vicinity are *Little Warley*, the East India Company's *Cavalry Barracks*, *Dognam Park*, and *Weald Hall*, C. Tower, Esq.
