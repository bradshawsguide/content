text: This Railway runs out to the left at this place, and will, when finished, prove to be a very valuable link in the railway system, as there will then be direct communication between the more westerly districts of South Wales and those of the Midland Counties. On leaving Abergavenny we cross the river Usk, and soon pass the stations of [Govilan](/stations/govilan) and [Gilwern](/stations/gilwern), and immediately enter the county of Brecon, at the entrance of which is the station of [Clydach](/stations/clydach); we then pass along the borders of the county to [Brynmawr](/stations/brynmawr). Again entering the county of Monmouth, we pass the stations of [Beaufort](/stations/beaufort) and [Trevil](/stations/trevil), and arrive at

**[Tredegar](/stations/nantybwch)**, the present terminus of the line, situated at the entrance to the Sirhowy Vale. The mineral qualifications of the surrounding districts have greatly contributed to its importance during the present century. The rest of the journey through Dowlais to Merthyr is performed by coach, which runs twice a day each way, in connection with the trains.
