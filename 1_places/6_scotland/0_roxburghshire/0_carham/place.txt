Text: Close at hand are the lone green round-headed Cheviot Mountains, and *Carham Castle*--another celebrated border fortress. There is good fishing in the river, and fine views from Skiddaw, one of the Cheviot Hills, to the south, where the highest peak rises 2,660 feet high. The famous border fight of *Chevy Chase*, or *Otterburn*, took place in one of its passes, in 1338.
