Text:

Here is Coker's *Free Grammar School*, in which Kay, the naturalist, (son of a blacksmith at Black-Notley) was a scholar. St. Michael's Church was enlarged previous to the Reformation "with the proceeds of three plays acted in it;" it has a fine tall spire, and contains the tomb of Dr. Collins, physician to Peter the Great. Tusser, the clever agricultural poet, was born at Rivenhall in 1515.
