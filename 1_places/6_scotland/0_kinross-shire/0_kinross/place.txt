text: Situated on the west side of Loch Leven. It has a population of 2,803, engaged in the weaving of linen and cotton. Loch Leven is about 3½ by 2½ miles and 11 in circumference. It is studded with islands, on one of which -- nearest to Kinross -- stands the celebrated castle in which was imprisoned the ill-fated Queen Mary in 1567. It was here, too, she was compelled by Lord Lindsay to abdicate her claim to the Scottish crown; soon after which, by the aid of George Douglas, she escaped from the castle. The loch affords tine sport to the angler.
