Up the *Cleddy* are *Lawrenny Hall*, seat of L. Philipps, Esq., on a bold point where two creeks branch off, one to Carew, Landshipping Quay, near which the two Cleddys unite. The west Cleddy may be followed to *Boulston*, an old seat of the Wogans; and Haverfordwest. The cast Cleddy, to *Picton*, Lord Milford's seat--a well wooded park with an old Norman castle; and *Slebech*, the seat of Baron de Rutzen. Here is an old chinch of the Knights Templars.
