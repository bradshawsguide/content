Text:

Here commences the "Vale of the White Horse," deriving its singular denomination from the gigantic carving of that useful quadruped, on a high chalky hill beyondâ€”but the cuttings that soon after succeed, "not long, but deep." effectually screen a very pretty country from the eyes of the traveller, save at occasional intervals, when an elevated embankment offers some transient glimpses.
