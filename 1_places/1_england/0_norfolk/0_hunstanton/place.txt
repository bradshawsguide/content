Here Sir Roger Lestrange, who edited the first "London Gazette," was born; there are remains of the old seat, and a lighthouse on the low cliffs which border this side of the Wash. In the vicinity is *Burnham Thorpe*, one of several Burnhams, near the north coast of Norfolk, which was the birthplace of *Horatio Nelson*, who was born at the parsonage (his father being rector), in 1758. When sent to sea he was so delicate looking that his uncle, Capt. Suckling, predicted he would be carried off by the first puff of wind; and he retained a thin battered appearance to the last. His name, for which the world was not too ride, is an anagram on one of his great battles,--*Honor a te Nilos**, literally "Honour to thee by the Nile." Norfolk has produced several great seamen; at *Cockthorpe*, in particular, were born,--Sir Christopher Mengs, of Charles II's time, a rough but hearty seaman, killed in battle with the Dutch, to the bitter grief of his sailors, who, as Pepys tells, "came him and Sir W. Coventry, after the funeral, begging a fire-ship that they might show their regard for their dead Commander, and their revenge, by the sacrifice of their own lives." He calls it one of the "most romantique cases that ever I heard in my life." Sir Jno. Narborough, another Admiral, was at first cabin boy to Mengs, and Sir Cloudesley Shorell was Narborough's-all three were natives of Cockthorpe. Lord Hawke was born at Docking. *Holkham*, the Earl of Leicester's seat, was built by the famous "Coke of Holkham," a descendant of the lawyer, and a distinguished agriculturist. Lord Burlington, who designed Burlington House, in Piccadilly, was the architect of this beautiful structure, which contains a rich collection of pictures (especially Claudes), marbles, books, busts, &c. Before Mr. Coke's time (1770), not a grain of wheat was sown all the way to Lynn.
