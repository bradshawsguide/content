text: Near to which is the old town of *Milton*, situated on a creek or arm of the Swale, in which the celebrated "Milton Natives" are dredged. The town was a demesne of the Saxon kings. In their straggle with king Alfred, the Danes had a camp here, the remains of which, popularly called "Castle Rough," yet exist. In the centre of the town there is an ancient court house. The church is large and handsome, with an embattled tower, chiefly in the decorated English style.
