Text:

[Cleghorn](/stations/cleghorn), the junction of the branch to Lanark. Hear are the ruins of an old chapel and a Roman camp.

Proceeding onwards, a distance of 2Â¾ miles, the whole of the neighbouring grounds to Lanark are remarkable as having been the hiding place of Sir William Wallace.

> Each rugged rock proclaims great Wallace' fame,
> Each cavern wild is honour'd with his name,
> Here in repose was stretched his mighty form,
> And there he sheltered from the night and storm.
