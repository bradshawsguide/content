In the churchyard at Meigle are some antique sculptured stones to Vanora the wife of King Arthur, who was taken away by his nephew Mordred, and concealed at Burryhill Camp, which is partly vitrified, and 180 feet high by 72. The Belliduff Tumulus has a granite pillar; and in the vicinity are Belmont, the seat of Lord Whamcliffe; Kinloch, J. Kinloch, Esq.; and Drumkilbo. A market is held here on Wednesdays, and there are fairs on the last Wednesday in June and October.
