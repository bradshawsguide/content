text: Niton has an old church, a little inland from the road, to the right. The seat of Sir J. W. Gordon, Bart, is passed before you come to this turning. The *Cripple Path*, a crooked way up the cliff. A milkwoman was once blown over this cliff, and, though she fell 60 or 70 feet, was picked up unhurt, having been buoyed up by her clothes. To the left are Puckester Cove, Sandrock, St. Catherine's Light, Pitland Landslip, only to be seen by following another path nearer the shore.
