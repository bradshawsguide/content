Text:

On leaving Glasgow we are immediately plunged a long tunnel, on emerging from which we soon reach [Bishop Briggs](/stations/bishop-briggs), and at a distance of 31 miles further, we arrive at [Campsie Junction](/stations/campsie-junction), where the line branches off to Lennoxtown.

(route: campsie-to-lennoxtown)

[Croy](/stations/croy).--Near to this station are *Holme*, the seat of H. Rose, Esq. and *Cantray*, that of J. Davidson, Esq.

[Castlecary](/stations/castlecary)--Here are the ruins of an ancient fort.

[Greenhill](/stations/greenhill) station.

(place: scotland/stirlingshire/falkirk)

Passing [Polmont](/stations/polmont), the point of junction with the Scottish Central section of the Caledonian Railway, we arrive at

[Manuel](/stations/manuel), near to which are the remains of an old abbey of the 12th century. A short line branches out here on our left to

(branch: start)
  [Boness](/stations/boness), a little straggling town on the Forth. It has a small coasting trade and some ship building.
(branch: end)

(route: manuel-to-airdrie)

On leaving Manuel we almost immediately enter the county of [Linlithgow](/places/scotland/linlithgowshire).

(place: scotland/linlithgowshire/linlithgow)

[Winchburgh](/stations/winchburgh).--Here Edward II. stopped after his defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn.

[Ratho](/stations/ratho).--Wilkie, author of "*Epigoniad*," minister here. In the vicinity are Ratho Hall, seat of W. Hill, Esq; Ratho House, R. Cadell Esq.; *Rathobyres*, Danehead, Mrs. Liston; *Kaimes Hill*, 680 feet high, and *South Platt cairns*, from which beautiful views may be obtained of the surrounding country.

(branch: start)
  The *Queensferry Branch* turns off here to our left. From Ratho we very soon cross the trout stream of the Almond, which here forms the boundary between Edinburgh and Linlithgow, over a viaduct of 30 arches to

  [Kirkliston](/stations/kirkliston), pleasantly situated on the margin of the river, the vicinity of which was the scene of a battle in the year 995, between General Kenneth and the usurper Constantine. The spot is marked by a stone pillar, 4Â½ feet high. A distance of two miles further brings us to

  [Dalmeny](/stations/dalmeny), the present terminus of the line, in the vicinity of which are several remains of antiquity. A little beyond is the ferry at *New Halls*, at which point the Forth is only about two miles wide. It is ultimately intended to connect this part of Fife by a continuance of the railway to Dunfermline.
(branch: end)

[Gogar](/stations/gogar).--Here stone coffins have been found, and in the vicinity are *Gogar House* and *Gogar Bank*, two pretty seats.

The cruciform church was built in 1429, and contains effigies and arms of the Foresters, and Lantern to light travellers over the marsh, the expense of which is defrayed from the
rent of Lamp Acre, in the possession of the master of the the parish school.
In the vicinity are *Prestonfield*, seat of Sir W. H. Dick, Bart., *Belmont* and *Beechmont*, two fine residences.
