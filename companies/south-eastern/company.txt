<span class="smcp">The London Terminus</span> of the South Eastern Railway is now very advantageously situated at Charing Cross. A second terminus is also fast progressing in Cannon Street, whilst the old station on the Southwark side of London Bridge, and the Bricklayers' Arms station, for goods traffic, conjointly accommodate the public. The South Eastern Railway conveys to and from these termini the passenger and goods traffic of a great portion of the county of Kent, and, via Dover and Calais, Folkestone and Boulogne, or Dover and Ostend, the passenger and goods traffic to and from Franco, and the North of Europe.

The main building of the London Bridge Terminus belongs to, and is appropriated as the booking offices of, the South Eastern and North Kent Railways, the offices of the London and Greenwich being on the left towards Tooley Street. The right or south-western portion belongs to, and is appropriated as the booking offices of, the London and Brighton and Sydenham Railways.
