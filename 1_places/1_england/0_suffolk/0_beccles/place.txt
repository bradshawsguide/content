Text: This town stands on the banks of the river Waveney, from which it is navigable, in the midst of a very pleasant country. The porch of the Church affords a beautiful specimen of the florid Gothic, and the church yard, a series of many interesting views of the country around. At Endgate are the ruins of another parish church, destroyed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
