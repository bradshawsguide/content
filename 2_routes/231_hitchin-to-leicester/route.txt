(place: england/herefordshire/hitchin)

The traffic of this line from London is at present conducted over a portion of the Great Northern Railway to Hitchin; but the company is expected ere long to have an independent entrance of its own to the metropolis through St. Albans, and Luton to Bedford. For a description of the route from London to Hitchin we must therefore refer the traveller to page 13.

The railway from Hitchin to Leicester was opened on the 8th May, 1857. It diverges to the left, crossing a narrow strip of the county of Herts, only about three quarters of a mile wide, and projecting two and a half into that of Bedford. Immediately on entering the latter we arrive at [Henlow](/stations/henlow) station--the town itself about l½ mile to our right, on the river Ivel.

[Shefford](/stations/shefford), 2½ miles; *Wrest Park*, the seat of Earl de Grey, four miles to the left.

[Southill](/stations/southill), 2½, and [Cardington](/stations/cardington), 4¼ miles.

[Bedford](/stations/bedford), 2½ miles.

(place: england/bedfordshire/bedford)

[Oakley](/stations/oakley), 3¾ miles, -- *Oakley House*, about half-a-mile to the left, belonging to the Marquis of Tavistock, a building of Charles II.'s time.

[Sharnbrook](/stations/sharnbrook), 3¾, and [Irchester](/stations/irchester) 6, five miles of which are in Bedfordshire, and the last one in Northamptonshire.

[Wellingborough](/stations/wellingborough), 2½ miles, a London and North Western station, between Northampton and Peterborough.

[Finedon](/stations/finedon), 3½ miles; [Isham](/stations/isham), 1 mile, a mile to the right of which is *Burton Latimer*, once the seat of the Latimers. Two and a half miles beyond Isham brings us to

(place: england/northamptonshire/kettering)

(branch: start)
  A line of railway very much reducing the distance between the Midland and Eastern Counties districts strikes out here to the left. The stations on the route are [Cranford](/stations/cranford) and [Twywell](/stations/twywell).

  [Thrapstone](/stations/thrapstone), in the midst of a highly-cultivated country; church cruciform, and of a mixed style of architecture.

  [Raunds](/stations/raunds), with its petrifying spring.

  [Kimbolton](/stations/kimbolton), the castle of which is an old stone pile, seat of the Duke of Manchester. Catherine of Aragon, the wife of Henry VIII. died here.

  [Graffham](/stations/graffham) and [Brampton](/stations/buckden) stations.

  (place: england/huntingdonshire/huntingdon)
(branch: end)

Returning again to Kettering, we pass through the stations of [Rushton](/stations/rushton), 3½ miles, and [Desborough](/stations/desborough), 2½ miles, to

[Market Harborough](/stations/market-harborough), 4¾ miles; at which we enter the county of Leicester.

(place: england/leicestershire/market-harborough)

[Kibworth](/stations/kibworth), 6 miles, with its rich living of St. Wilfrid, value £968, patron, Merton College, Oxon; and its well endowed Free Grammar School, Rev. J. B. Hildebrand, Master. Di. Aiken was a native, and here Doddridge first preached.

[Glen](/stations/glen) 2½ miles.

(place: england/leicestershire/wigston)

Shortly after leaving Wigston, we see the Ashby line, bearing away to the westward, and, passing through the Knighton Tunnel, 100 yards long, we arrive at
