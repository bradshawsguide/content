Text: This place derives its name from the Mercian chief, Algar, who lies buried here. The church is good, and contains tombs of the Berridges of *Algarkirk House*, an old seat of that family. In the vicinity are Sutterton and Swineshead churches, at the latter of which it is reported that a monk poisoned King John, after his escape, when crossing the Wash.
