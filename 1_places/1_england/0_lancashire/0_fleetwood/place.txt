text: (smcp: Fleetwood), at the mouth of the Wyre, built on what was formerly a rabbit warren, is a modern town and port, which had no existence before 1836, but now contains a market, custom house, gas works, quay, 600 ft., a church, four chapels, &c., with a commodious harbour, from which steamers go to Belfast and the Lakes. The Light House is of iron screwed into the rock below the sand. In the vicinity is *Rossall*, a collegiate school for the sons of clergy-men and others, with 250 pupils, and a full staff of masters.

A steamer crosses Morecambe Bay, on week days in summer, from Fleetwood to the Lakes district at 10¼ a.m., of which the nearest point is Piel.
