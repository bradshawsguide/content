text: <span class="smcp">Farnham</span> contains much to interest the tourist. Putting its celebrity for hops out of the question there is the old castle, which has been the seat of the bishops of Winchester since the time of King Stephen, and the neighbourhood abounds with vestiges of former monastic splendour. The exquisitely beautiful ruins of Waverley Abbey, about a mile from the town, are alone a reward for any pilgrimage that may be made from the station. It has the earliest Cistercian foundation in England, *Moore Park* was the seat of Temple, whose heart was buried in a silver box under the sun-dial. Swift was his secretary at the tune, and here wrote his correspondence with Stella.
