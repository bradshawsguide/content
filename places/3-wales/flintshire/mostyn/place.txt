text: This place has become of considerable importance from the collieries in the neighbourhood, producing about 70,000 tons annually, and which are considered the most extensive works in all the coal fields of Flintshire, and extend from east to west about twenty miles.

About half a mile on the left is *Mostyn Hall*, at which is the window through which Henry VII. escaped from Richard III., and the family pedigree, 42 feet in length, traced from Adam, the mansion of the late Hon. E. M. L. Mostyn, one of the oldest families in North Wales.
