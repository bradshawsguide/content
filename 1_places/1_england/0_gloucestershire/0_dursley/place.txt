Text: A very ancient town, but small, containing population of 2,477, engaged principally in the manufacture of woollen cloths. The church is of the style of the later English, with arms of the Berkeley family, to whom the town originally belonged. There are a good stone quarry, picturesque situated, and a hot spring in the churchyard. *Pier's Court* is near.
