This town has a population of 5,523, and is prettily situated on the slope of a hill in the vale of Blackmore. It was once the seat of a bishopric, but was removed to Old Sarum in 1075. The abbey was a long time after in existence, but was burnt in the reign of Henry VI. The abbey church was afterwards made parochial, and is one of the finest ecclesiastical structures in the west of England. There are likewise some remains of a castle. Near it is the mansion of the Earl of Digby, which was partly built by Sir Walter Raleigh, surrounded by picturesque scenery and sheltering groves, one of which was planted by this unfortunate but great man.
