There are numerous beautiful mansions in the vicinity of Colney Hatch, close to which is the *Lunatic Asylum*, on a site of 118 acres. *South Lodge*, the seat of the illustrious Chatham, is in a charming spot. The neighbourhood affords some very fine views; and a visit to Colney Hatch, during the summer season, is esteemed a great treat by the lovers of fine sylvan scenery. In the vicinity are *Arno's Grove*, seat of the Welds; *Culland's Grove*, Sir W. Curtis, Bart.; *Bowes Manor*, Lord Truro; and *Winchmore Hill*, a pretty rural spot.
