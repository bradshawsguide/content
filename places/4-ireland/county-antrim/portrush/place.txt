text: This small, yet pretty bathing place, which has Dr. Adam Clarke's School and monument, and where the mirage is often seen, is beautifully situated on a basalt peninsula, opposite the Skerries Rocks, and has an excellent view of the *Giant's Causeway*, to which this is the nearest railway station.
