Which is situated on the east coast of Scotland. at the mouth of the Firth of Forth, returns one member. The southern part of this county consists of a range of lofty mountains, which formed in ancient times a barrier for the defence of the county, and of the Scottish capital, against the invasions of the English.

This elevated district overlooks towards the north and north-east a fertile peninsula, descending gradually to the sea on the north and west, and which in every part exhibits marks of the most successful industry. These mountains are called the Lammermuir Hills, and form part or branch of a great range which crosses the whole island. A great portion of this county, or at least of the western part of it, from the borders of Lammermuir to the sea, rests upon a bed of the most valuable mineral strata; lime, coal, ironstone, and freestone, everywhere abound.

No county is, perhaps, embellished with a greater number of gentlemen's seats, all of them elegant and well situated, and some built in a style of grea magnificence.
