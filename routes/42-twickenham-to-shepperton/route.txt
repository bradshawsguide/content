text: The Thames Valley railway from Twickenham cuts off a small part of the county of Middlesex in passing the station of [Fulwell](/stations/fulwell) to [Hampton](/stations/hampton), on the north bank of the Thames, a little to the right of which is *Kenton Park*, once the seat of royalty, now the residence of T. Manners, Esq. Skirting the river to our left, we pass the station of [Sunbury](/stations/sunbury), and thence to [Shepperton](/stations/shepperton), on the Thames, where good fishing may be obtained.
