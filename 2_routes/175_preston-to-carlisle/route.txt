Text:

(place: england/lancashire/preston)

Passing [Broughton](/stations/broughton) and [Brock](/stations/brock) stations, at the latter of which is *Claughton Hall*, built in Charles I.'s time, but now a farm, and stone quarries in the  neighbourhood, we reach

(place: england/lancashire/garstang)

Passing [Scorton](/stations/scorton) station, we arrive at [Bay Horse](/stations/bay-horse). In the vicinity are Ellel Grange, seat of W. Preston Esq .; *Thurnham Hall*, the Daltons' seat, and *Ashton Hall*, on the Lune, the finely wooded park and princely seat of Le Gendre N. Starkie, Esq. (formerly of the Duke of Hamilton), which commands an extensive view of the Irish Sea.

Passing [Galgate](/stations/galgate), we reach

(place: england/lancashire/lancashire)

From the Lune Viaduct the line proceeds towards the shores of Morecambe Bay to

(place: england/lancashire/hest-bank)

(branch: start)
  A railway about 3 miles long, runs hence along the edge of the Lancaster Sands, *viâ* [Bare Lane](/stations/bare-lane), to the town of [Morecambe](/stations/morecambe).
(branch: end)

The lover of scenery will be delighted with the magnificent and bold scenery which presents itself, as the train passes onwards along the shore of Morecambe to the [Bolton-le-Sands](/stations/bolton-le-sands) station, and thence to

(place: england/lancashire/carnforth)

The line then proceeds along an embankment of great length, and reaches the Burton and Holme station. The former, Burton-in-Kendal, is a market town, with a population of 751. It contains an ancient church with side chapels, with monument of Cockin. Six miles beyond is Kirkby Lonsdale a market town, with a fine old Norman church, which I commands a beautiful view of the Valley Lune and Ingleborough; antique old market cross, grammar school, old stone bridge across the river, and an old inn mentioned by "Drunken Barnaby," and the latter is noted for its flax mills under Holme Fell and Tarleton Knot . When opposite Burton we pass from the county of Lancaster into [Westmorland](/places/england/westmorland).

Fourteen miles from Lancaster the line crosses the river Bela, and thence passes on the east side of Milnthorpe, by Rowell, Lower Woodhouse, Greenhead, and east of Hincester.

[Burton](/stations/burton) station.

(place: england/westmorland/milnthorpe)

The line thence crosses the canal at the tunnel, and pursues its course through a fine and well-wooded country, to the pleasant village of Sedgwick. At this point the magnitude of the Sedgwick embankment is seen to advantage. The course of the line is now by Natland to Oxenholme, previous to which it crosses the Burton turnpike road, about two miles south of Kendal. After passing an embankment, and through some heavy rock cutting, the train reaches

[Oxenholme](/stations/oxenholme), a telegraph station. At this point the line is joined by the Kendal and Windermere railway, which affords an easy and delightful means of access to the lake district from the north and south east.

A fine view of the town of Kendal is enjoyed at this station, the church spires, and blue roofs of the white houses which lie in the vale beneath; whilst far beyond rise the mountains of the west, the giants of the lake district.

(route: oxenholme-to-windermere)

## Oxenholme to Carlisle

From Oxenholme the line proceeds upon embankments and through cuttings, with occasional views of Kendal and its venerable old castle.

Soon after passing the Birkland cutting, the line skirts the base of the lofty Benson Knot, one of the highest hills in the neighbourhood, thence through heavy rock cuttings, and across an embankment we arrive at Docker Gill viaduct, one of the most beautiful structures on the line. It consists of six arches stretching across a valley. Half a mile from this splendid viaduct, the line is carried past *Morsedale Hall*, and half a mile further northward we arrive at Grayrigg Summit, where the line passes through a heavy cutting of hard material called same.

A mile onward is the Low Gill embankment, one of the *highest* in England.

(place: england/yorkshire/low-gill-and-sedbergh)

The railway now skirts the Dillicar hills, and the scenery around increases in picturesque beauty and grandeur. At various points the windings of the silvery Lune are discerned from the line, and soon afterwards the train passes through the great Dillicar cut. The line is carried over the Borrow Water, near its junction with the Lune, upon a neat viaduct.

About twenty yards from the line stands the remains of the ancient Roman station of Castle Field, by which the mountain pass was anciently defended. The railway now passes *Borrow Bridge*, a romantic spot, celebrated for trout fishing, the scenery about which is the most beautiful along the whole line, and the traveller seems to be completely hemmed in on all sides by stupendous hills. The village of Borrow Bridge appears on the right, at a short distance from the line, and near it winds the beautiful stream of the Lune.

Passing through the Borrow Bridge cutting we reach he Lune embankment, 95 feet deep, formed through the old bed of the river, which has been diverted from its course, through a tunnel excavated in the solid rock, 50 feet from the top, and made nearly parallel to the ravine. Proceeding onwards we pass the Lune excavations, Loup's Fell cutting, the Birbeck embankment, and the Birbeck viaduct--thence we arrive at the foot of the great incline--a plain of eight miles, rising 1 in 75, till it reaches the Shap summit.

(place: england/westmorland/tebay)

Proceeding from Tebay station we arrive at

(place: england/westmorland/shap-wells)

The railway passes through the fells, over which the Pretender and his army marched in 1745. At *Carl Lofts* are Danish stones, ½ mile long, and at *Gumerkeld* there still remains a Druid circle. Mills the critic was a native of *Hardendale*, distant one mile. Five miles beyond is *Hawes Water*, and eight miles to the east,

*Appleby*, the county town of Westmorland. The town is a very old one, having been associated with reminiscences not altogether of the most pleasing character from the time of the Norman Conquest.

(place: england/westmorland/appleby)

A mile and a half further we reach the Shap Summit,--the highest point of the most stupendous work on the line. We are now 888 feet above the level of the line at Morecambe Bay, and 1,000 feet above the level of the sea. Rising sixty feet overhead, on each side are rugged walls of hard rock, presenting a truly magnificent appearance.

Leaving the Shap summit, we enter a cutting through limestone rock, and before it approaches Shap village, the line runs through a circle of large boulder stones, said to be the inner circle of an ancient Druidical temple.

From Shap the line proceeds on the east side of the town of Shap, along a heavy cutting, and passing thence under a skew bridge, along the flat portion of the route called Shap Mines, and following the valley of the stream, the line again runs under the turnpike road, and thence passes Thrimby, through a thick plantation.

Here the character of the scenery is considerably altered, the bare, rugged, and sterile mountains being succeeded by fertile pastures and picturesque prospects.

The Kendal turnpike road is crossed for the last time, by a skew bridge at Clifton, near the entrance to Lowther Park, 6,000 acres in extent, in which, hidden by a forest of huge trees, stands *Lowther Castle*, the noble Gothic seat of the Earl of Lonsdale, built by Smirke in 1808.

The scenery between Shap and Clifton is very attractive--Cross Fell, Saddleback, Skiddaw, and the other hills in the lake district appearing to great advantage.

(place: england/westmorland/clifton)

From Clifton station we are carried along the Lowther embankment, and about 50 miles from Lancaster, and 20 from Carlisle, we cross the river Lowther on a magnificent viaduct, one of the most beautiful works of art on the line, 100 feet above the stream. Its arches, six in number, are of 60 feet span each. A mile and a half beyond, the line crosses the Eamont, on a viaduct of great beauty, consisting of five semi-circular arches. On the right is *Brougham Hall*, the seat of Lord Brougham, close to the old castle.

Leaving the county of Westmorland at this point we enter [Cumberland](/places/england/cumberland), the two counties being divided by the stream which we have just crossed.

Proceeding on from the frontier, the line immediately enters a large cutting-- and then running nearly level to the town of Penrith, we shortly after reach the station adjoining the ruins of the ancient castle.

(place: england/cumberland/penrith)

From Penrith the country is flat and uninteresting. The line enters the valley of the Petteril, through which it pursues almost a direct course to Carlisle, past the following stations, viz.:--[Plumpton](/stations/plumpton-cumberland), [Calthwaite](/stations/calthwaite), [Southwaite](/stations/southwaite), and [Wreay](/stations/wreay). In the vicinity are *Hutton Hall*, Sir R. Vane, Bart.; *Barrock Fell*, *Newbiggin Hall*; and *Petterill Bank*, J. Fawcett, Esq.
