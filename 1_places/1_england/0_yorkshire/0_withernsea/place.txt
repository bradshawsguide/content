Recently converted into a watering place, is making rapid advances to a very good one. It has an excellent Hotel, and commands one of the best possible views of the German Ocean. Situate about 18 miles from Hull.

The site of the church of St. Nicholas is now one-third of a mile out in the sea. About the fourteenth century, *Ravenspur Haven* stood here, but was washed away by the sea, and the De la Poles then settled at Hull.
