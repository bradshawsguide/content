text: Two miles distant is the Marquis of Anglesea's seat, *Beaudesert Park*, an old house, in Cannock Chase, the best view of which is from the camp on Castle Hill, where the early kings had a hunting seat. At present it is a tract of bare hills, more valuable for the coal andiron below its surface than for what is above. There are several works about *Rugeley* which belong to the Pagets (the Anglesea family).
