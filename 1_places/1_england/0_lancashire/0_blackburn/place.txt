Text: A borough town in Lancashire (returning two members), on the river Darwen, with a population of 63,126, employed in the cotton trade, Here is a gymnasium, erected by Messrs. Hornby and Kenworthy, for their workpeople. In the 17th century it was noted for its checks (a mixture of linen and cotton), and unbleached "greys;" but cottons, calicoes, and muslins are now the staple articles. The invention of the spinning jenny, by Hargreaves, who was a carpenter here, and the introduction of cotton printing, by the Peels, have mainly contributed to its improvement. A little cloth is woven. The scenery is flat and uninteresting. *St. Mary's* large parish church was built in 1826, close to the tower of the old building.
