text: A pleasant bathing and fishing port, in front of a fine bay which it has been proposed to convert into a harbour of refuge. The best view is from the Castle Mona Hotel (*Mona* is the Manx name for man), which was the seat of the Duke of Atholl, whose rights over the island (through the Stanleys) were finally purchased by government in 1829 for nearly half a million. Prior to this, its chief prosperity arose out of the smuggling business. There is a landing pier 530 feet long, also 4 churches and 6 chapels in some of which the service is performed in Manx; news rooms, &c. One of the best buildings is the Court House. The Duf-glas or Blackwater runs through the town to the bay from the mountains behind.
