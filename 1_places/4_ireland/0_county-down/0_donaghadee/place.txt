Text:

This place is favoured by nature, though somewhat improved by art, with a good and convenient harbour, from whence a submarine telegraph was laid down in 1853, across to the Scottish coast. In front of the harbour are the Copeland Islands, near which, before a lighthouse was built, the Enterprise sunk in 1801; she was loaded with dollars, a part of which was afterwards recovered by Bell in his diving apparatus.
