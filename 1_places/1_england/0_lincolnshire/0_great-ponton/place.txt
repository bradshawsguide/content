Text: (smcp: Great Ponton) is so called to distinguish it from Little Ponton, another parish betwixt this and Grantham. The Church of *Holy Cross* is a fine building, and the lofty tower, containing fine bells, forms a conspicuous feature in the landscape. In the vicinity is *Easton*, seat of Sir M. Cholmondeley, Bart.
