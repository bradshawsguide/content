(place: england/cheshire/nantwich)

The *Nantwich and Market Drayton* line runs out here, passing through the stations of [Audlem](/stations/audlem) and [Adderley](/stations/adderley) to

[Markey Drayton](/stations/market-drayton), the trade of which does not appear to be in a very flourishing condition, but which, no doubt, will receive an impetus after the completion of the railway through to Wellington, which is rapidly progressing.
