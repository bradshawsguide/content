(place: england/warwickshire/rugby)

From Rugby the line runs on an embankment, and crosses the river Avon on a viaduct, the arches of which are thirty feet span; it then passes over the Oxford canal, and through a very pretty country, crossing the north east section of the county of Warwick.

(place: england/warwickshire/atherstone)

At Atherstone the line crosses the old coach road. *Atherstone Hall* is the seat of C. A. Bracebridge, Esq.

The park contains some of the finest old oaks in England. *Merevale*, the fine seat of W. Dugdale, Esq. descendant of the antiquary.

(place: england/warwickshire/polesworth)

On nearing Tamworth the fine old church is a noble object in the view; and the country round being rather pretty the effect is greatly increased. In the vicinity is *Grendon Hall*, Sir T. Chetwynd, Bart. On approaching Tamworth we again enter the county of Stafford.

(place: england/staffordshire/tamworth)

As we approach Lichfield the magnificent and lofty spires of the Cathedral attract attention.

(place: england/staffordshire/rugeley)

The old roadway passes under the line, which is on a lofty embankment. The station is of pleasing design, stone fronted, and has all the variety of outline so essential to the true spirit of the Tudor style of architecture. *Hagley Hall*, seat of Lady de la Zouche.
