Montague, and monument of Day, who founded Fairlop fair; near it are the remains of the Abbey gate, and Holyrood chapel over it. In the vicinity are *Bufrons*, the seat of the Sterry family; and *Albury Hatch*, in Hainault Forest, in which stood the famous Fairlop Oak, 36 feet in girth. It is stated that Hainault may be spelt 2,301 different ways by as many different Frenchmen. -- *Sharp's British Gazetteer*.
