text: At this point is a short link connecting various systems of railway communication viz: North London, Eastern Counties, and Tilbury, and along which we now direct our course. On the left, but at some distance from the railway, is seen the square tower of *Stepney Church*, the mother church of most of the parishes in the eastern part of London. Immediately beneath us on the left is the Commercial Road, leading from Whitechapel to Blackwall, a distance of nearly 4 miles. Near the junction of the Camden Town and Blackwall Railways is the Commercial Road, 80 feet in width, and which is crossed by an iron viaduct, called Bow Spring Bridge, designed by L. Clase, Esq., and made by Messrs. Fox and Henderson, of Birmingham. Notwithstanding the great length of the viaduct, and the material of which it is constructed, it has a light and picturesque appearance. Having traversed the Commercial Road by Bow Spring Bridge, we soon leave the city and Pool of London behind us, and pass through fields to Bow Common, where to the right we have an extensive but distant view of the East India Docks, and, beyond them, a view of the Surrey and Kentish hills; on the left, the city of London, and Tower Hamlets Cemetery, occupying nearly thirty acres of ground, beautifully disposed, ornamented with cypress, cedar, and other trees, and most of the graves decorated with flowers and shrubs. Beyond the cemetery is seen the extensive buildings of the city of London Union Workhouse, which from its extent and architecture has a palatial appearance.
