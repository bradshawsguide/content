text: A small parliamentary town in *Berks*, with about 5,680 inhabitants, returning one member. It is situated at the junction of the Wiltshire and Berkshire canal on the Thames, and the mouth of the river Ock, occupying a very favourable situation on the borders of Berkshire. The town consists of several wide streets, converging in a spacious area, where the markets are held every Monday and Friday. It takes its present name from a rich mitred abbey which was founded by the Saxon kings. Before that, it was called *Seukestram* or *Shovesham*. Some traces of the abbey are seen at a brewery. Leland, who travelled the country as historiographer to Henry VIII., states that it was then a magnificent building. Geoffrey, of Monmouth, died abbot here, 1417. Henry I., called Beauclerc, for his learning, was sent, to this abbey by his father the Conqueror, to be educated.

The few buildings worth notice arc St. Nicholas's old church, a market house and county hall, of ashlar stone, the county bridewell, a grammar school founded in the 16th century, and Christ's hospital, an old cloistered building of the same date, founded by Sir John Mason, a native, and statesman of James I.'s age. Malting and sack-making are the chief employments. In Leland's time it "stondeth by clothing," like many other agricultural towns, from which this important branch of manufacture has fled to the north, where machinery, coal, and other conveniences are more abundant.
