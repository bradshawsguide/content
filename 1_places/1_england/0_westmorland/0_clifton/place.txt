text: In this neighbourhood, at Clifton Moor, a skirmish was fought in 1745, between the Pretender and the Duke of Cumberland, which is beautifully described by Sir Walter Scott, in "Waverley." Here is a mineral well, and the old turreted ruin close to the farmhouse was the seat of the Wybergs. In the church there is some good stained glass.
