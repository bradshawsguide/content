Text:

This place is interesting in many points of view, but more especially for its celebrated race-course. It is on the west side of Banstead Downs. During the race week Epsom has the appearance of a busy crowded city; and if the weather be fine, there are seldom less than 60,000 persons assembled here on the great day when the Derby Stakes are contested. The distance was done by Surplice, in 1848 in two minutes forty-eight seconds. Epsom is famous for its mineral spring, from which Epsom salts (sulphate of magnesia) is prepared. It has also a considerable cattle and wool fair. In the vicinity are *Horton Place*, 1 mile; *Nork House*, 2 miles; *Woodcote Park*, 1Â½ mile.
