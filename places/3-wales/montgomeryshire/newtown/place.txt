text: There is an old church here, some of the ornaments of which were spoil from the Abbey Cwmhir, in Radnorshire. A spacious flannel hall has been erected.

A short distance beyond Newtown is a romantic glen and waterfall; we then come to Llan-yr-Afange (the Beaver's pool) and four remarkable camps.
