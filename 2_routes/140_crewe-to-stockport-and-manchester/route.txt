(branch: start title: Stockport, Disley, and Whaley Bridge)
  This line branches off about a mile to the south of the Stockport station, passes the stations of [Davenport](/stations/davenport) and [Hazel Grove](/stations/hazel-grove), runs through Norbury Coal Field, leaving Poyton Hall a little to the right, under the Macclesfield Canal, skirts the eminence of Lyme Park and the pond at Disley, crossed under the turnpike road by a short turn, and then runs for the greater part of its course between the canal and the road leaving [New Mills](/stations/new-mills) a little to the left, and *via* the station of [Furness Vale](/stations/furness-vale) to

  (place: england/derbyshire/whaley-bridge)

  Leaving Whaley Bridge we proceed at once through the coal measures on Mr. Gisborne's estate, and when the smearings of the soil are washed off, the coal strata can be distinctly seen cropping out of the bank side. On crossing the stream, and after running through some deep cuttings, we have the peculiar hill scenery of Derbyshire before us. The tourist will seldom see such glorious landscapes from the window of the railway carriage as this line reveals. While at one moment the bold hills rise up before, behind, and on either side, at the next a winding valley shows us a charming picture, stretching away for miles. About midway on the line is Coombe's embankment. The trouble in forming this bank cannot be estimated.

  On leaving the station the new line runs through the Eaves tunnel, which is over 300 yards long; and at the end it skirts along the Old Peak Forest tramroad. At the distance of a quarter of a mile there is another tunnel, only 80 yards long. After leaving the second tunnel, the line divides the lime stone from the grit stone, and on the left bank the lime stone strata is discernible, while on the opposite bank the coal measures can plainly be distinguished.

  [Doveholes](/stations/doveholes) station is the next point of interest. Extensive lime works are carried on in the neighbourhood, which is very rich in Druidical remains.

  The line passes close to the enormous lime works carried on by Mr. Bibbington, of Rochdale. From Whaley Bridge to this point the line ascends, the average gradient being one in 66. In some parts, however, the steep is greater. From the starting point at Whaley Bridge to these lime works the rise amounts to 630 feet. It now, however, begins to descend, the gradient being about the same as before, during the two miles which form the remainder of the journey.
