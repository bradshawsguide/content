Text:

This is a parliamentary borough, with a population of about 6,172, employed chiefly in agriculture, and returns two members, and a bishop's see, since 1836, whose seat is near the city. The principal objects of attraction are the Cathedral, with its low towers, high stained window, and an underground Saxon Chapel, called St. Wilfrid's Needle, after the founder of the original Minster, in the seventh century. There are some antique royal portraits in the Deanery. The new Trinity Church; Aislabie pillar, 90 feet high; Edward VI.'s Grammar School; two old Hospitals (one dated 1140); and a Bridge of seventeen arches. In the vicinity are *Ellshaw Barrow*, 900 feet, and 216 slanting to the top-near which bones and Saxon coins have been found. *Fountains Abbey* (3½ miles from Ripon), the property of Lord de Grey and Ripon, the finest ruin in England. A description cannot be inserted within the compass of these pages, but the spot is peculiarly attractive to lovers of nature and art. The grounds are very beautiful, the foliage rich, and the ruin itself in the opinion of most people is unrivalled. A fixed charge is made to each person before entering, and extra fees are not allowed. Burton, the antiquary, was a native.
