Text:

Fenny Stratford is in a once fenny part of the Ouzel, on the Watling Street, or Roman way, which crosses the Ouse, further on, at *Stony Stratford*, where Richard III. seized his poor little nephew, Edward V. Lace and plait are made at both places. The Ouse, as it sluggishly winds down to Newport Pagnell.

> Now glitters in the sun, and now retires,
> A3 bashful yet impatient to be seen.
—(smcp: Cowper)

Much lace and some paper are made at Newport Pagnell; in the church is an epitaph by Cowper. *Gayhurst*, the seat of Lord Canington, 2 miles to the north-west, is an antique Elizabethan house, and has a portrait of Sir Kenelin Digby, who was born here, "a prodigy of learning, credulity, valour, and romance." *Hanslope*, on a hill, has an old Gothic church, with a spire 190 feet high. Olney, another town of lacemakers, with the house in which Cowper lived till 1786.

> Yon Cottager that weaves at her own door,
> *Pillow and bobbins* all her little store;
> Content though mean, &c.
> —(smcp: Cowper)'s *Truth*

Scott the commentator, and John Newton were curates of Olney, and the latter, in conjunction with Cowper, here wrote his well known Ohiey hymns.
