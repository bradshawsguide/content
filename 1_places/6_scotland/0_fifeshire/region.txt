Title: Fifeshire

----

Text:

Is an extensive maritime county in the eastern part of Scotland, and returns one member. The draining and cultivating of lands and lakes in all parts of this county has had a surprising and beneficial effect on the climate of the district. The fogs, which were constantly exhaling from the lochs and marshes, injured the crops of the better lands and afflicted the people with agues and other diseases. Fifeshire is divided into four districts: St. Andrews, Cupar, Dunfermline, and Kirkaldy. There are many ruins scattered over the surface of this county, consisting chiefly of castles and monastic establishments. The cattle of Fifeshire have long been in high repute, both as fattening and dairy stock.
