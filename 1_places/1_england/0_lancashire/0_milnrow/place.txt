Text:

A telegraph station, where lived the well-known Tim Bobbin, an eccentric schoolmaster, whose real name was Collier; he published various specimens of the Lancashire dialect, which attains a peculiar vigour and raciness about this part. His remains were interred in the old church yard at Rochdale, where the following epitaph may be seen:--

> Here lies John, and with him Mary,
> Cheek by jowl, and never vary;
> No wonder that they so agree,
> John wants no punch, and Moll no tea.
