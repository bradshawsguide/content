Text:

This is a neat and respectable town, close to the western border of Salisbury Plain, on which, in the neighbourhood, are many remains of the old Britons. There is likewise a huge rampart and ditch called "Old Ditch" which may be attributed to the Saxons. The church is spacious and handsome. The tower is of the reign of Edward III.
