Text:

Another town of straw plaiters. The Gothic church, built of chalk and flints, deserves notice. *Luton Hoo*, the fine seat of the Leighs. *Hoo* or *Hoe* means hill, and Luton *Lea Town*, probably from being at the source of the Lea; *Ivinghoe* lies among the hills. *Ashridge*, seat of Earl Ellesmere.
