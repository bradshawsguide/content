Text:

Wallingford, to which the station affords easy access, is an ancient and somewhat picturesque town, agreeably situated on the banks of the venerable Thames, and includes among its "lions" the remains of a formidable castle. The churches of St. Leonard's and St. Mary are of great antiquity. St. Peter's, a modern edifice, has a tower of very peculiar construction. A massive stone bridge, with nineteen arches, spans the river. It has a considerable trade in corn and malt.
