text: This railway runs from the station at Clifton along the Northern bank of the Avon. It skirts the edge of *Durdham Down*, passing the tower at *Cook's Folly*, from whence there is an extensive prospect, and at a distance of about two miles arrives at [Sea Mills](/stations/sea-mills), the first station at the confluence of the Trim. Passing onward along the edge of *Kings Weston Park*, the Clifford's old seat and property of P. Miles, Esq., we next come to

[Shirehampton](/stations/shirehampton), at the foot of *Penpole Hill*, the summit of which commands another fine view. *Lamplighter's Hall Inn*, a place much frequented in the summer months, is at hand. A distance of about two miles further brings us to

[Avonmouth](/stations/avonmouth), situated as the name expresses, at the mouth of the Channel, which place is accommodated with a good substantial Pier, the cost of which has been defrayed by the railway company.
