Text: This was the ancient *Salebia*. Here is an old timber  string bridge, and half ruined cruciform church, which was built in 1069; the tower fell down in 1690; it contains an old font, chapter house, and Norman porch. The Custom House, Town Hall, Shipyard, and the old Gothic Market Cross are worthy of notice. Henry I. Was a native.
