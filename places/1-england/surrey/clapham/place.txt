text: *Wimbledon Park*, the seat of the Earl Spencer, is seen to the right; thence crossing the old Surrey Railway, we at the same time pass over Garratt Lane, the little village adjoining, which was formerly the scene of a mock election, rendered popular by Foote's grotesque farce of the "Mayor of Garratt."
