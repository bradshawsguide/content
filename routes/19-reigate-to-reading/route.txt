text: This line connects the county towns of Berkshire and Surrey (Reading and Guildford), and extends from the latter across the garden of Surrey to Reigate; at the same time communicating with four trunk lines--the Great Western, the South Western, the Brighton, and the South Eastern Railway.

 To the pleasure tourist we scarcely know any presenting so many picturesque attractions. Its route lies from Reading along the South Eastern line, across Berkshire, by Wokingham and Sandhurst, entering Surrey by Tinley; then crossing the South Western line, onward with a branch to Farnham; at the base of Hog's Back to Guildford; next by a branch to Godalming, and continuing at the foot of the celebrated range of chalk hills past Dorking and Reigate to Red Hill.

We have alluded to the picturesqueness of the Surrey portion, which will be new ground to many a tourist; though it is perhaps, the most beautiful scenery of its class in England. Its landscapes present a rich succession of "morceaux" for the painter in its picturesque uplands, woodland, dells verdant vallies, rocky hills and undulating parks and heaths, all lying within the eye of the traveller along this line. Betchworth Park is among the most beautiful specimens of this scenery between Reigate and Dorking, although the part of the chalk hills seen from that point is greatly exceeded by the bolder sublimity of Box Hill, the venerable giant of the chain, with its luxuriant clothing of patronymic evergreen.

As a pleasure line, this portion is very popular, passing as it does through an exceedingly fine country, with the scenery of which excursion trains have already made thousands of visitors familiar.

Proceeding on our way, with the lofty down on our right, we pass over the Mole by a viaduct 50 feet high, and then through Box Tunnel to the station at

The line now diverges or turns more towards the north, to [Aldershott](/stations/aldershott-north-camp) station (North Camp), and thence to [Farnborough](/stations/farnborough-north), about a mile from the station of the same name on the [South Western](/routes/london-to-southampton-dorchester-and-weymouth) line.

The line then proceeds through the valley of the Blackwater to

A mile further is [Sandhurst](/stations/sandhurst) Royal Military College, situated to the right of the line, in the centre of a fine park. Peculiar interest attaches to this establishment, from the fact of its being the school where some of our ablest military men have acquired that rudimentary education which they have afterwards, turned to such good practical account in the field.

The railway then takes almost a direct line for several miles to

From this station the railway passes that of [Earley](/stations/earley) and over a level but highly cultivated country, interspersed with villages and country-seats, until it reach the terminus at
