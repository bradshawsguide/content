This delightful place has now become one of great importance as a summer resort. It is situated 3½ miles from Conway, on a promontory between the Bays of Conway and Llandudno. The water is very clear, and affords excellent bathing, and being protected on the north by the Great Orme's Head, the air is peculiarly salubrious. The old Church (dedicated to St. Tudno) stands on the mountain side. A new church was erected about 1839; but this is found much too small for the increasing requirements of the bathing season. There is also a fine market, well supplied with fish, vegetables, and in fact everything calculated to render the comforts of a temporary sojourn complete.

The scenery around is most picturesque, particularly so from the promenade which skirts the outer margin of the top of the mountain, at a height of 676 feet. The views from this point are of the most fascinating character. The town itself is in the very heart of the most attractive part3 of North Wales. It can boast of some good water excursions, embracing some curious and picturesque caves both on the Great and Little Orme's Head.
