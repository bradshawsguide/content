text: Few of the English counties present so great a variety of scenery and soil as Somerset. It possesses every gradation/from the lofty mountain and barren moor to the rich and cultivated vale, and then descends to the unimprovable marsh and fens. From Taunton to the coast extends a range of hills which slope towards Bridgewater, and on the other side they descend into a cultivated vale. Westward of this, and only terminating in the wild district of Exmoor Forest, the county is entirely mountainous and hilly. Between these there are many steep vallies, which form, when richly wooded, some of the most striking features of the beautiful scenery for which this coast is so deservedly celebrated.

Somerset, from its favourable climate and soil, stands very high in reputation for agricultural and rural produce.
