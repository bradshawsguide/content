Text: This parish was formerly famed or the immense quantity of fish caught in the lens. Whittleseamere is now drained by means of the centrifugal pump, and its 3,000 acres of land brought into cultivation. Connington round hill is one of the wonders of Huntingdonshire. Two miles distant is Stilton, famous for its cheese, the greatest portion of which is made at Melton Mowbray, in Leicestershire, and beyond is Yaxley, with its handsome Gothic church and crocketed spire, where S. Olinthus Gregory, the mathematician, was born in 1774.
