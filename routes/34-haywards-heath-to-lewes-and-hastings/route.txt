text: ### Hayward's Heath to Lewes and Newhaven

The line passes through an undulating, and in some places a hilly, country to

[Cook's Bridge](/stations/cooks-bridge), in the vicinity of which is *Coneyburrow Park*. We have here a full view of the lofty range of the south downs, the highest point of which, *Ditching Beacon*, a little to the right, is 858 feet above the sea.

### Lewes to Hailsham, Eastbourne, & Hastings.
The line from Lewes turns eastward, round the foot of Mount Caburn, and after passing through a valley in the South Downs, reaches the station at [Glynde](/stations/glynde). The line then passes the villages of Selmeston and Alceston to the station at

(place: england/sussex/berwick)

Four miles beyond, the line reaches the station at

(place: england/sussex/polegate)

Short lines branch off here in opposite directions to Hailsham and Eastbourne.

(route: polegate-to-eastbourne)

Immediately on leaving Polegate, eastward, commences the Pevensey level, the scene of the Norman Conquest; and the coast from hence to Hastings is rich in association with this grand chapter of our civilisation.

Proceeding eastward we pass along the coast on the very beach as it were, the view relieved only by the Martello towers, which here line the shore. A short distance to the left of the line is the retired village of *Hove* and its interesting church.
