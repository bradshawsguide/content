text: During the last twenty years this town has become of some importance, in consequence of several very extensive collieries and lead works which have been established here. A large portion of the lead ore produced in different parts of the kingdom is brought here for smelting. On the hill to the left are seen the ruins of *Basingwerk Abbey*, built by the Earls of Chester, beautifully situated just above the road, and commanding extensive views of the river Dee, Hilbree Island, &c. Close at hand is *Bagillt Hall*, the fine old seat of the Griffiths.
