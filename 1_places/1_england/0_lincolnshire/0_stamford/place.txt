Text:

(smcp: Stamford) is an ancient borough town, in the county of Lincoln, with a population of 8,047, who return two members. It is pleasantly situated on the banks of the Welland river, and bordering the counties of Rutland and Northampton. It is a town of great antiquity, being a place or considerable importance in the time of the Danes and the Saxons. The appearance of the town, when seen from a distance, is remarkably picturesque, many of the old buildings being grouped together with the towers and steeples of the neighbouring churches, the principal of which are *St. Mary's*, *St. Martin's*, *St. George's*, *All Saints'*, and *St. John's*. They are handsome edifices, and the latter one contains the ashes of Richard Cecil and his wife, the immediate progenitors of Lord Burleigh.

There is also a splendid monument to the memory of William Cecil, Baron Burleigh, one to Daniel Lambert, the fat man, who was 9½ feet in girth, and several others, well worthy of attention. The charitable institutions in this town are both numerous and well endowed; there are also many handsome public edifices, among which we may mention the *Theatre*, *Assembly Rooms*, the *Town Hall*, &c. Here Hengist routed the Picts, and Alfred allowed the Danes to live. In the vicinity is *Burleigh House*, the Marquis of Exeter's.
