In the vicinity are *Tortworth Court*, one mile, the seat of Earl Ducie. Attached to the park are noble woods and a gigantic chestnut, 50 feet in circumference, which was known as a boundary mark 1,000 years ago. Still further, about three miles, is another old market town, *Thornbury*, with a beautiful cruciform church, with lofty tower, and the remains of the palatial castle, begun by Stafford, Duke of Bucking-ham, but left incomplete ly his execution in 1522.

In its present dilapidated state even it shows the magnificence of the design. Two miles from Charfield, in the opposite direction, is the town of *Wotton-under-edge*, at the foot of a range of hills. hence its name; it is a large clothing town. At *Kingswood*, one mile, are the remains of a Cistercian abbey, founded in 1139 by one of the Berkeleys.
