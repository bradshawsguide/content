Text: On the Eye Water, on the wild hilly slope of the Lammermuir hills, which terminate at the coast on the right in St. Abb's Head and Fast Castle-the latter on a point usually identified as the Wolf's Crag of the Master of Ravenswood, in the *Bride of Lammermuir*. The slate cliffs here are 300 feet high, and pass after a time into the primitive basalt formation. A little beyond Grant's House is the deep pass of Peas Bridge.
