The village of King's Langley on the right, is remarkable for the square tower and short spire of its ancient church: there are several paper mills in the neighbourhood, that of the Messrs. Dickinson and Longman, at Two Waters, deserves a visit; good fishing abounds. Several iron coffins were found here in 1840.
