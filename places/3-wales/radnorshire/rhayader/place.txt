text: Or *Rhayader-Gwy*, i.e., the Falls of the Gwy (the Welsh name for the Wye), so called from a cascade made by the river, close to the bridge. The town stands among mountains, and has some fragments of a castle. About nine miles up the stream is Llyn Gwyn, in which croaking trout, are caught.

By all means the tourist should, if he have not already taken the ascent of the river, now do so, if he would see scenery that is really full of the poetry of nature: and he will not feel this sentiment more than when he views the *Nannarth Cliffs*, about 2Â½ miles up the river, and the junction with the Dernol. For some distance beyond, the stream rushes through a succession of darksome glens and fearful cascades, even to *Llangurig*, a place about ten miles from its source in the Plinlimmon mountains. The road proceeds along the valley of the Ystwith, by *Hafod* (the grandly-situated seat of Mr. Hoghton), and the *Devil's Bridge*, whence he may go along the valley of the Kheidol, and see the cascades, to Aberystwith.
