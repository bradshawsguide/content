This is a small municipal borough, containing a population of 5,742, chiefly employed in shipbuilding, the manufacture of sail-cloth, cordage, pottery, and bone lace. It has a free grammar school, at which Z. Mudge, a native, was the master; and Shebbearr, also a native, and author of <cite>Chrysal</cite>, &c., was educated. Hervey wrote part of his <cite>Meditations</cite> whilst curate at the church here. Strange, the philanthropist, who died of the plague in 1646, is buried here.
