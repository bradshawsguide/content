A coast guard station, prettily seated in a secluded creek on the Bristol Channel. *Dunster Castle* and the beautiful watering place of Minehead, standing on the cliffs to the south, are within a very short distance. A few miles further on the same coast, but somewhat more inland, brings the tourist to the sources of the Exe, in Exmore Forest, a wild but interesting tract, where the red deer is sometimes seen.
