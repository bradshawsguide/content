(place: england/cheshire/crewe)

To the right, soon after leaving Crewe, we perceive Bond Hill and Mow Cop, two large and lofty hills in Staffordshire, to the north of the Potteries. The line of the railway here so completely level that it vanishes in perspective. The church tower of Copenhall is seen on the left side of the road, and village on the right. This part of the country abounds with peat, and in many places is extremely boggy, and uninteresting to a railway traveller, from its sombre, cheerless aspect. In the distance to the left, however, the country is well cultivated, and the horizon is bounded by the outline of the Welsh mountains.

(place: england/cheshire/minshull-vernon)

Soon after leaving this station we pass through a cutting of considerable length, and thence the scenery becomes more interesting. We have views of Beeston Castle Hill, the highlands in Cheshire, Wales, and further on, in clear weather, the Derbyshire hills.

(place: england/cheshire/winsford)

Winsford station lies in a deep excavation, soon after leaving which we approach one of the finest and most remarkable parts of the line. The cuttings conceal it occasionally. There is a beautiful view of *Vale Royal*, the seat of Lord Delamere, situated in one of the most lovely vales in England, on each side of which are tracts of the richest pasture, and east and west the splendid valley, with its wooded hills and glens, spreads out and lengthens as we proceed. The Vale Royal Viaduct is a noble structure of red and variegated sandstone, consisting of five arches, and affords a fine prospect of the river Weaver and its course through this beautiful vale.

Passing on through a deep and picturesque ravine we shortly arrive at

(place: england/cheshire/hartford)

(place: england/cheshire/acton)

On leaving this station we pass through frequent cuttings, and finally reach a long embankment which leads to the magnificent Dutton Viaduct over the river Weaver, and the Value of Dutton. This admirable and gigantic bridge is more than a quarter of a mile long, consisting of twenty arches, formed of red sandstone. The imposing grandeur of this fine piece of work is greatly enhanced by the beauty of the scenery, and the almost boundless view from the center of the viaduct. The prospect from the valley below, including the viaduct, is equally worthy of admiration.

Proceeding on the line passes along the Dutton embankment, which is carried over the Dutton Bottoms, where there are many beautiful hills and dells, richly clothed with luxurious plantations, and affording delicious glimpses of scenery. On the left is *Aston Hall*, a noble edifice. Thence we pass through a short tunnel and arrive at

(place: england/cheshire/preston-brook)

From this station we proceed through an excavation and tunnel, and thence pass under an aqueduct for the Bridgewater Cancel which runs through *Norton Park*, seat of Sir R. Brooke, Bart. The basement story of the priory still contains some most interesting Norman remains, in a state of good preservation.

The line then proceeds through the Moore Hill excavations, and reaches

(place: england/cheshire/moore)

Soon after leaving this station we reach the Arpley embankment, and pass over the Mersey Viaduct. This, though less grand in appearance than the Dutton Viaduct, is a fine work, consisting of twelve arches, through three of which the river Mersey, and the Mersey and Irwell canal pass. The valley of the Mersey is spread before us, and on each side the scenery is very beautiful, consisting principally of rich pasture land, adorned with farm-houses and cottages.

A short, distance beyond this the river winds towards the town of Warrington, with its manufactory chimneys, large buildings, and churches, &c.

Continuing along the embankment the train soon arrives at

(place: england/lancashire/warrington)

[Warrington Junction](/stations/warrington-junction), [Newton Bridge](/stations/newton-bridge), and [Preston Junction](/stations/preston-junction) stations.
