In the vicinity of this place is *Newstead Abbey*, formerly Byron's seat, to which he succeeded when only 10 years old, and was sold by him to Colonel Wildman. Mr. Rogers of Nottingham was his tutor before he entered the army. Part of the abbey church (founded in the l2th century) is the mansion, round which are grouped the great hall, cloisters, and other remains of the original Gothic pile. His favourite Newfoundland dog, Boatswain, is buried in a garden, under the well-know cynical epitaph. In clearing the lake on one occasion, a brass eagle was found, whose hollow breast contained the Abbey papers, sealed up; the eagle is now in Southwell church. *Annesley Park* was a seat of the Chaworths, from whom it came to the late J. Musters, Esq., of Colwick. The church contains some old monuments.
