An old cathedral town, parliamentary borough (two members), and the capital of Norfolk. Norwich is agreeably situated on the banks of the Wensum, at a short distance from its junction with the Yare. The Wensum flows through the town, the principal part of which, however, is on the south side of the river, occupying the summit and sides of a hill, which rises by a gentle ascent from the south and west, but is much more steep on the other two sides, which are terminated by the valley of the river. The prospect of the city from a little distance is both imposing and beautiful. The massive walls of the old castle, crowning the summit of the hill, form the central object in the view, the lofty spire of the cathedral, and those of the numerous parish churches rising in all directions, give it an air of great magnificence, and mixed with this architectural grandeur is much more than the usual share of rural scenery to be found in populous cities, arising from the many large spaces of ground that are laid out as gardens, or planted with fruit trees. The introduction of the woollen manufacture first established the wealth and eminence of Norwich. A short distance south of it is Caistor, once an important Roman station (*Venta Icenorum*), upon whose decline Norwich grew apace, so that at the Conquest it had 25 churches of mood, and in 1300 had 60. Thirty-six of these remain, one to each parish, built of flint, all destitute of spires to the towers, (many of which are round), and none later than the 15th century.

The noble *Cathedral*, on the east side of the town, tas begun in 1096 (when the see was moved hither from Thetford), by Bishop Herbert de Lozinga, and after various events was finished in 1510. It is shaped as usual like a cross, 398 feet long internally, to the choir, which is rounded off at the east end; 15 flying buttresses support the sides, and the whole is surmounted by a Norman tower (rebuilt in 1361), and crochetted spire, 315 feet high. The west front is partly Norman. The stone roof of the nave rests on massive pillars with spiral flutings. It has a fine commemorative window of stained glass, to Bishop Stanley, lato of that see. which is very beautiful. There are various chapels and monuments, among which are those of Roger Bigod, Anne Boleyn's grandfather, and Chantrey's statue of Bishop Bathurst, one of his latest works. The fine Gothic cloister, 185 ft. square, is of the 15th century.

Close by is the *Bishop's Palace*, begun in 1318; ita old hall, 110 feet long, was utterly ruined by the Puritans, who destroyed the Chapter House, all the brasses and painted windows of the Cathedral, and suspended Bishop Hall, who describes their ravages in his "Hard Measure." "What work was here, (says the Bishop); what beating down of walls; what tearing up of monuments, what pulling down of seats; what wresting out of irons and brass from the windows and graves; what defacing of arms; what demolishing of curious stonework, that had not any representation in the world but only of the cost of the founder and skill of the mason; and what a hideous triumph on the market-day before all the country; when organ-pipes, vestments, surplices, and service books were burnt near the cross (now gone)." Here Master Bilney, the martyr was burnt in bloody Mary's disastrous reign, in 1531. The Ethelbert and Erpingham gates leading to the close, ald the gates of the Bishop's Palace, also deserve notice. On the hill to the south is the castle built by Bigod at the Conquest; the great Norman keep, 70 feet high (with a tomb in it, both by W. Wilkins, a native architect, and called after him). The barbican bridge, and two others towers are incorporated with the *County Gaol*, built in 1818, for 200 prisoners, and the *Shire Hall*, built in 1822, in the Tudor style. The bridge just mentioned is said to be a complete circle, as mach being below the ground as above it. A double railing runs round the castle precincts; the hill on which it stands is artificial. The *Cattle Market*, one of the largest out of London, is held on a piece of ground to the south.

A little test of the Castle is the *Town Market*, a large open space, with some old fashioned gable-fronted houses, above which rises the solid tomer of *Mancroft Church*. The *Guildhall* is in one corner, an old flint Gothic edifice, built in 1453; besides portraits of William III. (with his serious face and hooked nose), it contains an interesting relic, namely, a letter of Nelson's sent with the sword of one of the Spanish admirals, taken at St. Vincent. A short distance from here stands St. Andrew's Hall, built by the Erpinghams, in 1415, and alterwards given, in the reign of Elizabeth, to the banished Walloons, who introduced the bombasin manufacture, now turned into a room for festivals and public meetings. It is, along with the Friars' Kitchen, incorporated with the buildings of the Home of Industry. As modernized in 1774, it is 124ft. long by 70 broad, resting on pillars, lit by upwards of 48 windows, and ornamented with many portraits by Opie, Gainsborough, and other artists. One of the best is Beechey's portrait of Nelson, said to be an excellent likeness; Queen Anne and her husband, ("*Est-il possible?*") by whom she had nineteen children, and Horace Walpole, are in the list. At a grand dinner given to the Duke of Norfolk in this hall, three centuries ago, the Mayor's share of the cost was £l 12s. 6d., but flour was then only 6d. per bushel. There is a *Museum* in St. Andrew's-street.

*St. Peter Mancroft Church* is the largest in the city (after the cathedral), 212 feet long, and later English in the style; tomer, 100 feet high. One tomb is that of Sir Thomas Browne the physician, and author of the "Religio Medici:" his portrait is in the vestry. The oldest church in Norwich is that of *St. Julian* near the river and Southgate; part is Norman, but the church was founded before the Conquest. *St. Ethelred's* near it is almost as old. A little beyond St. Stephen's Gates is the *Norfolk and Norwich Hospital*, *St. Giles*, is the highest church, and is marked by a tower of 120 feet; an old town gate stood here, and the site of the fortified walls and ditch may be traced; beyond it is the *City Gaol and House of Correction*, built in 1827, by P. Barnes. The tower of *St. Lawrence* is 112 feet high; the saint and his gridiron are carved over the gate. In Saxon times the tide came up to the church, which had a quay for fish in front.

About ten short bridges cross the Yare and Wen-sum, the most ancient being *Bishop's Bridge*, built in 1295, near *St. Helen's Church*. Close at hand is the *Dungeon Tower*, 52 feet high, built in the 14th century. *Cavalry Burracks* at Porkthorpe.

The *Grammar School* is a very old institution, dating from 1325, when it was founded by Bishop Salmon; it was held in what was the Charnel House, at the west end of the Cathedral. Here Archbishop Parker, a native of Norwich, (born in 1504); Dr. Kaye or Caius, another native, founder of Cains College, Cambridge; the great lawyer Coke; Nelson; Maltby, the late Bishop of Durham; Dr. Samuel Clarke, also a native, were educated. The last became chaplain to Bishop More. He was so full of logic and so precise in its employment that Voltaire styled him a *moulin à rasionnement* "a reasoning machine." The *Boy's Hospital* is near St. Edmund's, Fishergate, and the *Girl's* in Golden Dog Lane, St. Saviour's parish. An *Hospital* for old meu and women, near the cathedral; also *Doughty's Hospital*, in Calvert Street. The *Blind Asylum*, in Magdalen Street; the *Infirmary* for pauper lunatics, in the outskirts, just out of St. Augustine's Gates.

On Bank Plain is Gurney's Bank, established by an old Norfolk family, equally known for their good works and philanthropy. The Norwich Union insurance Office, in Surrey Street founded in 1808, which insures three-sevenths of the whole farming stock insured by the country offices. Dr. Enfield, the well known author of the "Speaker," died here in 1797, minister of the *Octagon Chapel* (for Unitarians); here Taylor the German scholar was buried. He corresponded much with Southey, and edited the *Norwich Iris* for the two years it lasted. One of the earliest country papers was the Norwich Gazette, which Cave (of the *Gentleman's Magazine*) published in 1706.

Norwich covers a tract of about 1½ by 1 mile. In Fuller's time most of the houses were thatched. "Norwich," he says, "is like a great volume with a bad cover, having at best but parchment walls about it." Silk and worsted stuffs are the chief manufactures of Norwich, with shoes, &c., and various articles incidental to a large agricultural town. The staple branches of trade are in a flourishing state. There are factories for mohair, silk, and worsted. Opposite St. James's Church is Fastalff's House or Palace, once the seat of Sir John Fastalff's of Caistor, a valiant knight of (Henry IV.'s. time) Erpingham, who built the gate near the Cathedral, on which his effigy is carved, and distinguished him self at Agincourt in the next reign.

(smcp: Excursions).--Many interesting objects are within a short distance of the city. A little west is *Heigham Church*, in which Bishop Hall was buried, our English Seneca, as he has been aptly called by Fuller, though he was indeed something better, for he practised that philosophy and resignation which the other only wrote about, and did not practise so well. Never were the proportions of a Christian divine, a sweet gravity, useful learning, manly piety, clear common sense, and a genuine English style more truly hit than in the character and writings of this wise and excellent prelate. The house in which he died in 1656, aged s? (nine years after the sequestration of his diocese) is nor an inn. *Mousehold Heath*, which overlooks the city, was the head quarters of Kett the tanner, in his rising in 1549. What is called Kett's Castle is part of a priory which was given to the Dukes of Norfolk, and made a seat by them, bearing the name of Mount Surrey House they had another, a very magnificent one, near Newgate, in the city. Three miles this side also is *Thorpe*, a fine open spot, covered with villas, and the seat of Colonel Harvey. *Rackheath*, (4 miles), Sir E. Stracey, Bart., formerly a priory cell. *Earlham*, (2 miles), the Gurneys' seat, where the pious and inestimable Elizabeth Fry mas bom, of a Quaker family of four generations. She married and came to London, and began that life of usefulness which has made her name honoured throughout the land. Though a preacher at the meeting, and placed in the midst always retained her own natural soft low voice, womanly tenderness, and retiring modesty, "touching you with the gentlest hand in the world." One of her works, besides her labours at Newgate, was to induce the Government to establish libraries for the Coast Guard service. *Costessey* or *Cossey Park*, the Jerningham's seat (Lord Stafford), has been rebuilt in the Elizabethan style. *Kimberley*, the ancient seat of Lord Wodehouse, the descendant of a very ancient family. *Melton*, belongs to E. Lombe, Esq. *Blickling* was the seat of the Boleyn family, and here Anne Boleyn was born, and afterwards married to Henry VIII. There is a brass of her in the church. The seat, *Blickling Hall*, Dowager Lady Suffeld, was rebuilt 1628, in the Elizabethan style. *Gunton*, the seat of Lord Suffield. *Cromer*, a pleasant bathing place on the cliffs of the North Sea, is suffering from its encroachments, by which the land is fast swallowed up, and converted into dangerous shoals for the coasters. Crabs, lobsters, amber, and shells are got. *Cromer Hall*, the late seat of the Wyndhams, but now of the Buxton Family. *Felbrig Church* contains good brasses of the Felbrigs, and is near *Felbrig Hall*, the Lucan's seat, who took the name of Wyndham. *Worsted* is Worsted is worth notice as having given an English name to the manufacture of worsted, first introduced by the Flemings in Henry I's reign. The soil about here and along the coast is sand and gravel; several shallow lakes and ruined churches are seen, the parishes being frequently overrun with sand, or half en-gulped by the sea. At Holme, near Horning, are the remains of St. Bennett's Abbey, which, though visited by Henry VIII.'s commissioners, was not destroyed, but given by act of parliament to the Bishop of the diocese, who sits, or may claim to sit, ig titular Abbot of Holme. *Caistor* (8 miles), so called from *Castram*, a camp, was the ancient *Garionum*, an important Roman position, where several military ways met. In Henry V.'s time it was the seat of Sir John Fastalff, a famous soldier, who greatly contributed to the victory of Agincourt; and no way related to the immortal Jack Falstaff, whose best exploits were those of robbing tapsters and serving-men, misusing the king's press, easing fat citizens of their purses in the dark on Gad's Hill, and routing men in buckram, or fighting with Harry Hotspur (after he was down) a long hour by Shrewsbury clock.
