To the left of this station may be seen the Three Eildon Hills, having *Trimontium*, a Roman camp, on the highest, which is 1,630 feet. *Bemerside*, the fine old seat of the Haig family, is also near. Overtopping the trees on the fine wooded slope of this hill may be seen the monument to Sir William Wallace, erected by the Duke of Buccleugh, from whence a most magnificent view can be obtained in clear weather.

At a distance of two miles Dryburgh Abbey may be reached by a beautiful walk along the tortuous Tweed. This ruin was formerly in possession of the Buchan family, who were ejected some years ago; some fantastic modern monuments, which disgraced the owner's taste, have been removed.
The ruin is in a good state of preservation, and worth visiting, and may be described in the words of the poet:--

> There fifty monks have sung the pray'r
> To God, the King of all;
> There Scott and Lockhart sleep, and wait
> The last great judgment call.

The town of St. Boswells lies a mile to the right of the station. It is a neat little country village, with excellent hotel accommodation. It mainly belongs to the Duke of Buccleugh, and is used by him as a hunting seat. It stands on a range of cliffs, overlooking the beautiful Tweed, the tops of which present to the eye some of the most lovely and enchanting scenery. Excellent trout fishing, and affords great facilities for visitors to Drybugh, Smailholm, Abbotsford, &c.
