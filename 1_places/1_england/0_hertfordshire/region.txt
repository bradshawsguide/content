text: There is no county of its size so rich in associations, and in stately seats of noblemen and gentlemen as the small inland county of Hertfordshire.

York, Kent, and Surrey are only richer from their greater size. It is true that Herts has no cathedral; but sue has St.Alban's Abbey, one of the oldest and most instructive of all oar mediæval buildings; then, she has Verulam, with its rich store of Roman remains; Gorhambury, sacred to the shade of the great Lord Bacon; Hatfield, rich in the wisdom of the Cecils; Panshanger, with its noble old oaks and picture gallery, second to none in Italian art in England; Cashiobury, with the pictures by Vandyke, Wilkle, Landseer, and Lely, and its woods and waters; the Grove, with that noble gallery of portraits formed by the great Lord Chancellor Clarendon; Moor Park, with its trees, not to be surpassed in England; Knebworth, with the Lytton associations and its Bulwer interest, &c.; and in conclusion Herts, with its sweet sylvan scenes, and trout streams—the Colne and the Chep.

To see the west side of Hertfordshire easily, an excursion tourist should get out at the Watford station.
