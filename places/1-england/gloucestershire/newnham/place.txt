text: Newnham stands on an eminence rising from the western bank of the Severn, which is here nearly a mile across at high water. In the Norman times, it appears to have been a fortified town, designed to repress the incursions of the Welsh. The houses are principally ranged in one long street, and the church stands on a cliff, near the river.
