Text:

It occupies the site of a Roman town called *Segontium*, of which there are various relics in the museum. The well-preserved castle, built between 1284 and 1320, is the most interesting object; it covers 2Â½ acres. There are remains of the gateway, the Queen's gates and the Eagle tower in which it is stated Edward II., the first Prince of Wales, was born. It should be mounted for the view. The outer walls are 10 feet thick and guarded by thirteen toawers variously shaped. One of them is the town prison.

In the vicinity is *Llanberis* (8 miles), the most convenient starting point for *Snowdon*.
