Title: County Cork

----

Text:

Which greatly exceeds the other counties, both in population and extent, and returns two members. It reaches along the south coast of the island from Youghal Bay to the more westerly point of Beerhaven, a distance of 160 miles, and is remarkably mountainous. With the exception of a few spots of small extent, there is absolutely no level land; even the vallies, as they are called, are full of swells and ridges. The general appearance of the country is varied and beautiful, the principal defect being want of trees, which are seldom planted except by the great landowners. The richest part of this county is towards the north, and a great quantity of limestone is found in the fertile districts. The south coast has many excellent harbours, and abounds in rivers.
