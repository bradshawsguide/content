Text:

The village itself does not possess anything worthy of notice; but there are extensive stone quarries about 1½ mile distant, the quality of which material being well adapted for building, will in all probability cause many villas and residences to be erected here.

A short distance south-east of Caterham is the extensive domain of *Marden Park*, and a mile beyond, the little village of *Godstone*.
