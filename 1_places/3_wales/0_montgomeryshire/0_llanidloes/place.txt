Text:

Situated at the confluence of the rivers Clywedog and Severn, returns one member to parliament, and has a population of 3,127, principally engaged in the manufacture of woollen and coarse flannels. The church contains some interesting remains.

From this we may visit the source of the Rheidol, and *Blaen Hafran*, the source of the Severn on the edge of Plinlimmon. The road hence to *Machynlleth* is full of grand scenery (a distance of 18 miles), and we may add, the wildest road in the kingdom.
