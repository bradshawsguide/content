Text:

It is a place celebrated for its manufacture of Plate and Crown Glass, very much of; which is certainly got up to great perfection. An hour or two spent in the inspection of some of these works, particularly those of the Union Plate Glass Co. would amply repay the stranger. The streets of the town itself present no definite plan of arrangement, but seem to have been laid out as chance or interest might direct; and the houses are by no means remarkable for their architectural beauty.
