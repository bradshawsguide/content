text: An old Norman town, founded by Bernard Newmarch; part of the castle remains, which was destroyed by Owen Glyndwr. It is exactly on the borders of three counties, Brecon, Hereford, and Radnor. Here the Upper Wye scenery ends. Barges are able to reach this point. Clifford Castle, three miles from Hay, was the birthplace of Fair Rosamond Clifford. It was built by the Conqueror's kinsman, Fitz-Osborne.
