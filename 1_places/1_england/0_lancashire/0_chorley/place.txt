Text:

This is a market-town, with a population of 15,013, engaged in the cotton trade, and working the coal, lead, and slate mines. Here is *St Laurence's* Church, with its old monuments, *St George's*, built in the Gothic style in 1825, and an excellent *Grammar School*. In the vicinity are *Astley Hall*, Lady Highten, *Gillibrand Hall*, H. Fazakerley, Esq., and the *Bleaching Works*, which are well worth a visit.
