Text:

On leaving the station at Belfast we immediately cross the river Lagan, which flows into Belfast Lough, and enter the county [Down](/places/ireland/county-down).

Taking the direction of the river Knock, we pass the station of that name; thence to [Dundonald](/stations/dundonald), and

[Comber](/stations/comber), with its old castle, Druidical remains, and a church, built on the site of an old abbey, Fairs, January 14th, April 5th, June 28th, and October 19th.

  A branch line runs hence to Donaghadee, a distance of fourteen miles. The first station we arrive at is

Retracing our steps to the junction at Comber, we pass on, *via* [Ballygowan](/stations/ballygowan) and [Saintfield](/stations/saintfield) to [Ballynahinch Junction](/stations/ballynahinch), the town itself lying at the extremity of a short line to our right, about lÂ½ mile long.
