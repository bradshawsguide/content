Text: This borough has a population of 13,794, who return one member, and are employed in the woollen trade. The town was built by Vanburgh. It has a fine suspension bridge, by Telford. The gate of the old castle is worth a visit. Turner, the botanist, Gibbon, the herbalist, and Morrison, the Chinese scholar, born in 1782, were natives; and here Horsley, the learned author of *Britannia Romana*, was a minister. In the vicinity is *Mitford*, seat of Mrs. Mitford.
