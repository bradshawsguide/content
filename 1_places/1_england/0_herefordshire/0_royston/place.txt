Text:

This market town, in the county of Hertford, is pleasantly situated in a valley, among the chalk downs of Hertford, on the borders of Cambridge-shire, and crossed in the lower part by the celebrated Roman road called the Icknield Way.

Royston is chiefly supported by its corn trade. The old *Priory Church*, and remains of King James I.'s hunting box, where his favourite, Carr, was arrested for killing Sir T. Overbury, are worth notice. In the vicinity are *Kneezworth*, Sir C. Nightingale's, Bart., and *Wimpole*, Lord Hardwicke's, at which are Titian's portraits of Loyola and Raphael.
