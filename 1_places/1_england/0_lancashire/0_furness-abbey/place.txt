text: This abbey, beautifully placed in the wooded glen of Beckunsgill, or Nightshade Vale, was founded by Stephen, 1127. The remains are part of a Norman church, chapter-house, hall, cloisters, school-gate lodge, mills, granaries, watch-tower, with a most extensive and superb view of the adjacent country. Iron is now forged in this vicinity, where the stag, wolf, and wild boar were formerly hunted. In the neighbourhood is *Gleaston Castle*.
