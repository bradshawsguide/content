text: <span class="smcp">Llanrwst</span>, once noted for its Welsh harpmakers, lies on the east bank of the river Conway, about 12 miles from Conway, and is situated in one of the prettiest spots of North Wales. It ought not to be overlooked.

In the vicinity is *Trefriw*, in a hollow of the Carnarvonshire hills, where there are some salubrious mineral waters. One of the Inland Company's Steamers makes the trip to Conway every week day during the summer months. This trip affords some really fine and much-commended views of the valley of the Conway, every bend of the river disclosing some hitherto undiscovered loveliness.
