Text: This place was formerly the capital of the county. The moat of the castle still remains. Kings Alexander II. and III. were married here in great pomp. Close to a holly in the river, James II. was killed by the bursting of a cannon, in 1460. Good purple trout abound in the streams. In the vicinity are *Makerstown*, the fine country seat of Sir T. Brisbane, Bart., and *Smailholm Tower*, "the scene of one of Scott's ballads, and the frequent resort of his grandfather."
