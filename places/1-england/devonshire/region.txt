text: This county is one of the most beautiful in England, and in point of size is only exceeded by that of York. It is about 280 miles in circuit. Its external appearance is varied and irregular; and the heights in many parts, particularly in the vicinity of Dartmouth, swell into mountains.

Dartmoor, and the waste called Dartmoor Forest, occupy the greater portion of the western district, winch extends from the vale of Exeter to the banks of the river Tamar.

The cultivated lands of West Devon are nearly all inclosures, being in general large in proportion to the size of the farms. North Devon comprehends the country round Bideford.
