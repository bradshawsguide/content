text: The *Lyrpool*, or *Litherpool*, of early times, when it was an insignificant chapelry, sent one little bark with 6 men to the siege of Calais, in 1333, Hastings then sending 21 tall ships, but is now the second port in the United Kingdom, as well as a parliamentary borough, &c., with a population of 443,938, who return two members. It stands fronting the Irish Sea on the north side of the Mersey's mouth, at the south extremity of Lancashire, 210 miles from London, by the North Western Railway, via Warrington; 230 miles by way of Birkenhead and Chester; and as near as can be in the centre of the British Islands.

The site a sloping rock of red sandstone, through which three tunnels are cut from the Edge Hill Station—one to the Lime Street terminus (opposite St. George's Hall), another for goods, of 1¼ mile long, to Wapping, and a third, as long, to Clarence Dock. The Mersey, above the town, widens into a little shallow sea, 2 miles wide in one part; while at the mouth it is choked by large sandbanks, leaving two main entrances—the Victoria Channel, 12 miles long, the most used—and the Rock Channel, 10 miles in length. Besides the Floating Light Ship there is a handsome stone Light House off New Brighton, like the Eddystone, and 90 feet high.

The Docks, which are the grand lions of the town, extend in one magnificent range of 5 miles along the river, from Toxteth Park to Kirkdale; the newer ones being near the latter suburb, to the north, and most of them constructed since 1845. All steamers can enter (except some of the very largest), which are obliged to anchor in the river. The Collingwood, one of the finest docks in this quarter, is 500 yards long and 160 wide, and covers a space of 13¼ acres. Clarence dock to the south of these, is of an older date. Prince's dock is also 500 yards long, and chiefly used by American liners. At George's dock, in front of St. Nicholas' Church, is the new *Floating Pier*, whence steamers run to various points of the river. Canning dock, since it was altered, is 500 yards long, including what was the old dock. Albert dock was opened in 1845, by Prince Albert, with warehouses surrounding it, on the Loudon plan—the usual practice at Liverpool being to build warehouses separate from the docks. Passing the tobacco, timber, salt, and other docks, you come to that called the Herculaneum, at the south end of the chain. Altogether the 21 docks have 15 miles of quay room, will hold 1500 sail, and enclose 200 acres of water. The dock dues in 1840 were £224,000; the tonnage in 1846 belonging to the port was 390,000, while the total tonnage trading inwards and outwards exceeded that of London. Customs, however, were only £3,620.000, while London was 11 millions. In the same year the exports of all kinds were valued at 28½ millions sterling; the imports from Ireland alone were 8 millions. These numbers may serve to give an idea of the extent of its commercial relations. To this we may add that nearly 2 million bales of raw cotton are imported for the staple supply of the factories dispersed through Lancashire—a wonderful quantity compared with the little bag which a private firm sent from America in 1785, as a venture, along with other goods. Liverpool, as might be expected, is a great emigrant port. As many as 206,000, for whose use half a million tons of shipping were required, started in 1851. A large Home has been built near the docks for their accommodation. The ship-building establishments of Messrs. Rennie & Co.—Jordan and Getty—Cato and Miller—Steel and Challoner— and Laird's, Clayton and Kereven, and Glover and Royle's on the Birkenhead side, are particularly worth inspecting.

The town covers a space of 7 to 8 square miles; Castle, Lord, Bold, and other streets near the docks are the most bustling; Rodney, Parliament, and Shaw Streets, the best built. The public buildings are—the *Collegiate Institution*, designed by H. Ehnes, in Shaw Street, built in 1843, in the Tudor style, 300 feet long. The magnificent establishment lately erected in Church Street, by Messrs. Elkingtoh and Co., the interior of which should certainly be viewed. The *Town Hall*, at one end of Castle Street, is a handsome pile, by J. Foster, on a rustic base, with a portico of four columns, and under an open dome, built in 1795. Lawrence's portrait of George III., and Chantrey's statue of Canning are here. In the *Exchange* quadrangle behind is Westmacott's statue of Nelson. At the other end of Castle Street is the *Custom House*, a very extensive building, also by Foster, with a dome and four Ionic porticoes, in one of which is a statue of Huskisson. It occupies the site of the first dock cut at Liverpool, in 1699. The *Post Office* and other offices are collected under this roof. Close to this is the new *Sailors' Home*, a striking building in the Italian style, built in 1850, 190 feet long, with turrets at the corners, and full of windows.

There are excellent libraries at the Athenaeum and Lyceum news rooms, which represent the two great political parties in the town; the former is in Bold Street, and the latter in Church Street. New *Music Hall*, 175 feet long, in Hope Street, built in 1849. *St. John's Market*, in Elliott Street, was built in 1812, by Foster, and is 560 feet long; it covers 2 acres, intersected by five walks, and is a scene of extra- ordinary bustle on market days. The *Theatre* is in Williamson Square, near the Amphitheatre, both of good size. It was on the stage of the former that the celebrated actor, Palmer, died in 1798, after uttering the words—" there is another and a better world." Large *Poor House*, on Brownlow Hill, near the *Lunatic Asylum*, and the *Infirmary*—the latter built by Foster, with a six column portico.

The best building, and perhaps the finest in all England, is *St. George's Hall*, opposite Lime Street Railway Station. It was originally designed by H. Ehnes, a very promising young architect, since dead. Its dimensions are 600 feet by 170, surrounded by Grecian columns of truly magnilioent proportions including assize and other courts. The building was begun in 1841, and was opened by Her Majesty in 1855; it cost about £200,000. Many of its decorations and exterior approaches are still incomplete. The Public Hall is 180 feet long and 84 high, with a marble floor, and a vaulted roof of hollow bricks. The Concert Room will hold 1400 persons. The Nisi Prius and Crown Courts form a half circle, 60 feet by 50, with an arched-panelled ceiling, resting on granite pillars. There are 16 fluted pillars in the east portico, 40 feet high, on a flight of steps 200 feet long. In the south portico are 8 pillars, and Gibson's statue of G. Stephenson. The basement is ventilated by small air-holes along the floor line.

*St. James' Cemetery* is a really attractive spot, in Upper Duke Street, laid out in an old quarry, with catacombs, and a mausoleum containing Gibson's statue of Huskisson, the statesman, who represented Liverpool when he was killed at the opening of the railway to Manchester, in 1830. The *Necropolis Cemetery* is in the Everton Road. The *Mechanics' Institution*, in Mount Street, is in fact an excellent school, established in 1835, by the liberal party, previous to the Collegiate Institution, which was set up by the conservatives. Lord Brougham laid the foundation stone. In Colquitt Street is the *Royal Institution School*, founded by Roscoe; with a gallery of marbles and casts (among others, the Panhellenium casts, the only ones in England). Romney's cartoons, Gibson's (of his falling angels); and a museum, (Roscoe's portrait is here; he lived when a youth at Mount Pleasant, and published his Lorenzo de Medici at Liverpool). *Blue Coat School* is behind Church Street. *Blind School* (oldest in England) in Hardraan Street; Hilton's "Christ giving sight to the blind" is here. The baths and washhouses in Frederick Street, opened June, 1842, were the first of the kind erected in England.

(smcp: Churches and Chapels.)—85 altogether, of which 40 belong to the establishment. Liverpool forms one parish, with two rectors. *St. Nicholas*, the mother church, is near the docks, and has Gibson's monument of Mr. Earle, a tower and lantern, rebuilt in 1810, with the bells of St. Selsher's, Winford, presented by Cromwell; the first church here dates back to 1361, and held a favourite shrine to the patron saint of seamen. *St. Peter's*, the other parish church, is a plain building. *St. Luke's*, at the top of Bold Street, is a very handsome imitation of the Gothic style, finished in 1831, from Foster's designs, at a cost of £44,000. *St. George's*, or the corporation church, in Castle Street, which stands on the site of a castle, begun by Henry II., which came to the Stanleys and Molyneuxs, is also by Foster. *St. Michael's*, in Kent. Street, has a steeple 200 feet high. That of *St Martin's*, in Scotland Road, is as high, Gothic, by Foster. *Everton Church*, on a hill, has a conspicuous tower, 340 feet above the river. It was here that Prince Rupert fixed his head-quarters in the siege of 1644. It is a great place for toffy. *St. Paul's*, in Prince's Park, is a fine modern Gothic church, built for *Dr. M'Neile*, in 1850, with a tall spire. The park covers 40 acres, with a lake, villas, &c, round it. Near this is a pretty green spot called the Dingle, opening to me river. Among the *Chapels* are, Dr. Raffles', in George Street; the original one was rather a handsome building, oval within, the seats rising towards the wall, built in 1811, but since burnt, and the present one erected on its site. *Baptist Chapel*, in Myrtle Street. *Roman Catholic Chapels of St. Nicholas*, in Blake Street, and *St. Anthony*, in Scotland Road. *Unitarian Chapel*, in Hope Street, with Thorwaldsen's relief. All these are in the Gothic style.

In the vicinity of the town are the *Botanic Gardens*, on a site of 11 acres; the *Cattle Market*, at Stanley; the *Sessions House*, at Kirkdale, near the *Industrial School* for 1,150 children; New Church, in a decorated English style, at *Fairfield*, with a tower of 147 feet; and Mr. Lascelles' *Observatory*, where a satellite of Neptune, and an additional one of Saturn, have been discovered. The *Dock Observatory*, under Mr. Hartnup, is a red granite tower, having a 12-foot equatorial telescope, &c.

Legh Richmond was born in St. Paul's Square, and Mrs. Hemans, in Duke Street. Gibson, one of the greatest living sculptors, though not a native, is best known here by some of his choicest productions. Mr. R. Yates has his *Cupid and Butterfly*; Mrs. Sandbach, his *Greek Hunter and Aurora*; Mr. Mines, his *Sappho*.

Within a few miles of Liverpool are the following: *Booth*. *Waterloo*, and *Southport*, bathing-places on the coast of the Irish Sea. *Scarisbrick*, C. Scarisbrick, Esq.; here are pictures by J. Martin, who died in 1854. *Knowsley*, Earl of Derby, in a large park, which till lately contained a valuable museum of natural history, and menagerie (the greater portion of which was collected by that indefatigable, scientific, and learned botanist, Dr. Thomas Whitfield, during a long residence at Sierra Leone, where his gratuitous medical aid to the Western Africans has deeply endeared him to all classes of natives and Europeans); part of which was bequeathed to the people of Liverpool. The Stanley portraits are here, from the first Earl, Henry VII.'s father-in-law. *Croxteth Park*, Earl of Sefton, the seat of the Molyneux family; the house is in part ancient. *Wavertree*, a pretty country village, with part of an ancient well at the pond, dated 1414. At *Childwall*, belonging to the Marquis of Salisbury, are some remains of a priory. *Allerton* was the seat of Roscoe, in his prosperous days, where he lived happy with his books, which he so feelingly laments parting with:—

> Loved associates, chiefs of elder art!
> Teachers of wisdom, who could once beguile
> My tedious hours, and brighten every toil.

Here Gibson, then a youth, used to visit him. *Hale*, seat of J. Blackburne, Esq., was the birth place of a giant, called the *Child* of Hale, 9¼ feet in height. *Hazles*, Sir T. Birch, Bart. *Prescot* is a thriving town for pottery, watch tools, files, &c., at the west corner of the great coal field. John Kemble was born here in 1757. At *St. Helens* are large and old established plate glass works.

The Cheshire side of the Mersey is now a prosperous suburb of Liverpool, with a softer climate and more attractive scenery. Birkenhead is a growing port, with a *floating dock* formed by Wallasey Pool, of 150 acres. It has two or three, handsome churches, a vast square of six acres, market-house, and some fragments of a priory of the 12th century. It has also a public park, certainly not one of the largest, but, as a model, allowed to be one of the finest in England. *Bidston Hill* and lighthouse are behind; and *Stourton Quarry*, in which ripple marks have been discovered by geologists. *Rock Ferry*, *Bromborough*, and *Eastham*, up the river, are charming spots. Hooton Hall, belongs to J. Naylor, Esq. This part of Cheshire is called the Wirrall.

**Hoylake.**—This place is approached from Birkenhead by omnibus; it is a quiet watering place at the mouth of the Dee.

**New Brighton.**—Hotel, Victoria, first class; distance from Liverpool, by steamer, 6 miles; or from Birkenhead, by hired conveyance, 5 miles. It is a very pleasant watering place on the Cheshire side of the Mersey, and derives its chief interest from the beautiful panorama which the shipping on the river constantly affords. Excursions may be made to Leasowe Castle, Birkenhead Park, Eastham, &c.

The facility and cheapness of steam transit, either by rail or boat, gives the tourist an excellent opportunity of making Liverpool the starting point to some delightful spots on the Welsh coast. During the summer months there is daily steam communication between Menai Bridge, Bangor, Beaumaris, and Liverpool. The passage is accomplished in about five hours.

Another route for those who like to enjoy the country by occasionally pedestrianising, is to take the packet from Liverpool to Rhyl, or Mostyn, North Wales, and thence continue the journey on foot, or the line of railway from Chester to Holyhead, which affords the same facilities for reaching picturesque stations.
