Text: *Caistor*, so called *Thong*, (because Hengist, after destroying the Picts, obtained from Vortigern as much land as an ox hide would cover, and imitating the founder of Carthage, he cut it into thongs) should be visited, as the curious old Norman Church stands on the site of Hengist's Castle. Population, 2,141.
