title: County Wicklow
----
text: The greater part of this county, which returns two members, is mountainous. Towards the interior this Alpine region is boggy, uncultivated, and rendered additionally cheerless by the want of wood; but throughout a long extent of its borders, and particularly on the sea coast, it assumes a splendour and variety of scenery not to be surpassed in any part of the island. The mountains and rocky elevations are here magnificently bold, and the country is plentifully clothed with ornamental wood. Agriculture is still in a backward state, though considerable improvements have been recently introduced.
