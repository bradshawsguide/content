text: Dartford, built in a valley between two hills, derives its name from its situation on a ford of the River Darent. The insurrection of Wat Tyler originated in this town, and it has also been the scene of many other important events, the record of which would excite but little interest passing railway traveller. The trade is, however, considerable. It exports agricultural produce, and there are important gunpowder mills, corn and paper mills, establishments for calico and silk, printing, and iron foundries in the neighbourhood. It has a large market, held on Saturdays. A large embattled gateway, and a stone wall enclosing 12 acres, are to be seen, the sole remains of its great nunnery, founded by Edward III. in 1371.
