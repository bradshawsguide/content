Title: Huntingdonshire

Text:

Huntingdon is a large county which borders on the fenny districts of Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.

It was formerly covered with woods, but has been deforested. Along the course of the river Ouse extends a tract of beautiful and fertile meadows, including the well-known Portholm Mead, near Huntingdon, nearly the whole of which are now abundantly productive, the extensive system of drainage adopted having in the course of a quarter of a century rendered them comparatively tree from floods; and, where the clay bed is not too deep, the process of mixing it with the top soil has been of great service to its productive powers. The fen lands are estimated at 11,000 acres.

The most celebrated article produced by the dairies of Huntingdonshire is the cheese termed "Stilton," which is chiefly made at a village of that name. Though a great portion of this much-approved article is from the luxuriant pastures of Leicestershire, it received its name rather from having been at first brought into notice at Stilton during the time that this place was of much greater importance than it is now.

The extensive barracks, in which thousands of French prisoners were confined during the long war terminating in 1814, have been entirely removed, and its military character altogether lost.
