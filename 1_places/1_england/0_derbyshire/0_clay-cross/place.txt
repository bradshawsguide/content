Text: This is the nearest station for *Hardwick Hall* situated on the extreme eastern borders of the county, adjoining that of Nottingham. It is a noble Elizabethan seat belonging to the Duke of Devonshire, finished in 1584, by the famous Countess Elizabeth. The picture gallery (full of historical portraits) is a magnificent apartment, lit by vast bay windows; and one room contains the bed worked by Queen Mary of Scotland, who was kept prisoner here.
