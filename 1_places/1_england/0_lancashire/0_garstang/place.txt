Text:

This town, which was burnt by the Scots in 1322 has a population of 4,011 employed in the cotton trade. The church, rebuilt in 1790, is erected on the site of one founded out of Old Carlisle--the ancient *Olenacum*. Clarke the poet, and Smirke the painter were natives. Here are print and dye works, tanneries &c. In the vicinity is *Wigton Hall*, seat of Rev. R. Matthews.
