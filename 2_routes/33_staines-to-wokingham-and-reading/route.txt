On leaving Staines, we soon arrive at

(place: england/surrey/egham)

We then pass along two miles of beautiful scenery and reach

(place: england/surrey/virginia-water)

[Sunningdale](/stations/sunningdale) station.

(place: england/berkshire/ascot)

Further on a little to the right, is Binfield and its beechwoods, all beautiful. Indeed the whole of Berkshire, from end to end, abounds in endless attractions to the lover of country scenery.

We shortly after reach [Bracknell](/stations/bracknell) station, containing a population of 108. It has a pretty modern church, built by Coe.

[Wokingham](/stations/wokingham).
