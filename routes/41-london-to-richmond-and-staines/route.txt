text: ### Wandsworth to Barnes
The Richmond line properly branches off about the point where the road to the village of Battersea leaves the Wandsworth road, and at a short distance from Battersea. It then pursues a pretty course through the villas, orchards, and nursery gardens which stud that locality, till it reaches Wandsworth. The river Wandle and the valley are crossed by a splendid viaduct.

On leaving Wandsworth we have for a moment a picturesque peep at the Thames, and the line pursues a southerly direction through a deep cutting of some extent, until we reach

(place: england/surrey/putney)

On emerging from the cutting and passing this station, we proceed over a level country to Barnes Common, which the line crosses.

### Barnes to Windsor
A great portion of the line is but a few feet above the natural surface of the country, and many of the roads are crossed on a level. The country through which it passes does not present many picturesque views, the property almost throughout being circumscribed by orchards and market gardens.

The remainder of our course to Richmond lies through fields and gardens, catching a glimpse of Kew Gardens, and the Pagoda on our right, and passing some prettily built almshouses, and a castellated building used as a barracks; also, on our right, we come to the station in Kew road, at

(place: england/surrey/richmond)

The line crosses the Thames over the railway bridge at Richmond--a very handsome structure of three arches.

A line of railway here turns off to the left.
