text: Is a town of note, and boasts of the celebrated St. Magnus's Cathedral, a gorgeous pile of great antiquity, and well preserved.

Hotel accommodation is good. Kirkwall is one of the northern six burghs that returns a member. Kirkwall is also the birthplace of the celebrated Laing family, famous as travellers, historians, and antiquarians, and of Mr. Samuel Laing, late finance minister in India. The population is very intelligent, but the lack of outlet for local industry is greatly felt. Boats can always be had for conveyance to the islands, which abound in interesting sights; and regular mail and packet boats ply to and from the larger islands. In that of Shapinshay, one of the finest mansion-houses of the North, that of Mr. Balfour, of Trenaby, is to be found.

Agriculture and fishing are the only employments of any extent, and the former has of late years made great improvements. The exports of cattle are very extensive.
