Text:

(smcp: Buckingham) has a population of 7,626: agriculture and lace making occupy their attention. The church, built in 1781, on the site of a castle, has rather a pretty appearance--the spire is 150 feet. A beautiful painting of Raphael's Transfiguration, the gift of the Duke of Buckingham, decorates the altar.

At a distance of two miles from here is *Stowe*, the late magnificent residence of the Duke of Buckingham. It is a noble structure, in the Grecian style, designed by Lords Camelford and Cobham. Its internal decorations, consisting of works of art in plate, furniture, &c., were of the most costly description, and these, together with a library of 10,000 volumes, a large collection of MSS., portraits and engravings, with the principal family estates, were sold by auction in 1848, to pay off a mortgage debt of one and a half million.
