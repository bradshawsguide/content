The splendid seat of the Duke of Devonshire, truly called the Palace of the Peak. A seat was begun by the founder of the family, Sir W. Cavendish (who was gentleman-usher to Wolsey, and wrote his life), about 1570, when he had the custody of Mary of Scotland here; and finished by his widow, a rich and clever woman, iho married the Earl of Shrewsbury, her fourth husband. This was rebuilt in 1688-1706 by the first Duke, from designs by Wren, and now forms the principal building--a noble Grecian, or Italianised-Grecian pile, about 180 feet square, much in the style of the Governor's house at Greenwich Hospital (another of Wren's works), with a rustic base, Ionic columns, pilasters, frieze, and balustrade, ornamented by urns and statues. To the north is Wyatville's new wing in the Grecian style, built of the variegated stone from Beely quarry. The terraces in front are 1,200 feet long. The Sub Hall at entering contains busts, &c., and leads through a corridor (closed with velvet hangings) to the Great Hall, with its marble floor. Here are paintings by Verrio and Laguerre (French artists, whose works figure at Hampton Court and elsewhere), a Turkish caique, a marble slab, 11 feet long, and an inscription stating that "These paternal halls were begun *anno libertatis Anglice* (year of the great Revolution, which the first Duke helped materially to bring about) and finished *anno mœreus* 1840" (when the Duke's niece died).

The *State rooms*, 190 feet long, are full of cabinets, paintings, tapestries, &c., with alabaster doors, carved mainscot, mosaic oak floor. Some of the best of G. Gibbon's wood carvings are seen here, especially a pen and a net of game in the Ante-Room. Vansomers's portrait of the first Duke is in the Dining Room. The South galleries contain above 1,000 original drawings, by foreign masters, and cabinet pictures. Granet's Monks at Prayer, is on the west stairs. In the Billiard Room--Landseer's well-known "Bolton Abbey in the Olden Time," and Eastlake's Spartan Isadas. The Chapel is ornamented with paintings, Cibber's Faith and Hope, in alabaster, &c.; the Communion table is a beaului piece of malachite, from Russia. Music Room--Rembrandt's "Jewish Rabbi," Giardano's "Neptune" and Murillo's "Belisarius." Grand Drawing Room, 15 feet long--portraits of Mary, Queen of Scots, Henry VIII., Charles I., Philip II. (by Titian); marble tables, Bartolini's Venus de Medicis, &c. North Staircase--portraits of George IV. by Lawrence, and the late Emperor Nicholas. Library, 90 feet long--carved mahogany doors and bookcases, marble mantel-piece. In the Dining Room are family portraits, marble slabs and chimney pieces. The *Sculpture Gallery* is extremely rich in original works, as well as casts, busts, marble tables, &c. Among others are Napoleon's Mother--Madame Mere, as she was called-by Canova; Canova's large bust of Napoleon; Pozzi's Latina and her Children. Schadon's Filatrice or Spinning Girl; Hebe, by Canova; Petrarch's Laura, by the same; bronze copy of his Kneeling Magdalene; 'Gibson's "Man Cupid" (his first work from Rome), and "Hero and Leander;" Finelli's "Cupid and the Butterfly" (*i.e.*, Psyche, or the soul); Chantrey's bust of Canning; Canteen's granite vase, 20 feet round, &c. In the Orangery, further on, 108 feet long, are Thorwaldsen's "Priamand Achilles," and trees which belonged to the Empress Josephine. In one room is a very large enamel of Lady Southampton, 10 inches by 6, by Pettet. Over the Ball Room is a temple with a fine view of the park. All these rooms form a suite nearly 560 feet long, when the doors are thrown open.

Descending to the Green House, you pass two figures of Isis and Osiris, brought from the Great Temple at Carnac, by Mr. Bankes. The Water Works (by Grillet) are in the style of those at Versailles; one is shaped like a coffee tree; another throws a jet of 90 feet; and the great one, a jet of 200 feet. The *Grand Conservatory* is the chief ornament here; it is 300 feet long and to feet high, of metal and glass, from the designs of the late Sir Joseph Paston, the late Duke's celebrated gardener. His success here led to the adoption of a similar building for the Great Exhibition, the Crystal palace, and other edifices of a similar character. A carriage drive and a railway run round it. Besides palms and other tropical plants, there is the large Victoria Regia, an immense piece of Blue John, or fluor spar, and Queen Victoria's Oak, planted by Her Majesty when on a visit, in 1852. Also, Chesnuts, planted by the late Emperor of Russia, and the Duke of Kent. Marshal Tallard was on parole, Hobbs lived, and Christian VII. visited here in 1768.

A belt of moorland cliffs, richly wooded with pines, chestnut, beech, limes, sycamore, and other trees, and about 11 miles in circuit, surrounds the park and grounds, which are stocked with 2,000 head of deer. The best view of the house is from a point near the bridge, and Queen Mary's Bower, where the old hunting tower is seen on the hills behind. The house may be seen daily from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Parties are let in by turns. To save time early application should be made. Edensor Church is an old building, and has a fine monument of the first Earl of Devonshire. The cottages are in the Tudor, Swiss, and other styles.

As the country in the neighbourhood is so full of startling and magnificent scenery, we will briefly enumerate the most interesting objects to be met with in a tour of a few miles. Two miles from Bakewell is *Ashford Hall*, Hon. -- Cavendish, Esq., with its extensive quarries of black and grey marble. *Hassop Park*, three miles, Lord Kinnaird. A little further is *Longstone Hall*; one mile from which is Blakelow Tor. Hence, crossing the ridge called Longstone Edge, by *Stoney Middleton*, to *Eyam*, its lead mines, and a rock called *Cucklett Church*, where its ancient rector, Mompesson, preached during the plague of 1666. *Calver*, another seat of the Arkwrights. We then have choice of two routes for the north, both indeed good, and in which the same general character prevails. One is by the banks of the foaming and impetuous Derwent, as it rushes over the rocky projections in its passage by *Grindleford* and *Lead Mill Ford*, and then by *Hathersage* (1,300 feet high), to *Brough*, in *Hopedale*. Brough was a Roman station of much importance; here some old roads unite, and ramparts and other foundations are yet to be seen. The other road, by *Wardlaw*, takes us to the old town of *Tideswell*, amidst bleak and moorish hills, having an ancient cross church with a handsome pinnacled tower, and richly ornamented Gothic windows. A romantic road in which there is grandeur and sublimity combined with solitary stillness, takes as due north to *Castleton*; situated in a vale at the foot of a steep rock, on which stands *Peak Castle*, built by William Peveril, the son of the Conqueror. Within a short distance are *Mam Tor*, raising its giant head 1,300 feet above the valley below. Here are a Roman camp, the ancient mine of Odin, and the Peak Cavern. We here recommend a walk through the region beyond to the Glossop station of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire line (but not without a good map), every step imparting a delight and interest inconceivable. From Castleton, westward, the road passes through a chasm, whose walls are about 1,000 feet high, called the *Winnetts*. Thence leading past the *Eldon Hill*, with its remarkable chasm, or as it is popularly called *Eldon Hole*--said to be unfathomable, to the town of *Chapel-en-le-Frith*, a very neat town on a hill, in the centre of a hollow formed by the mountains around; the church is of the fourteenth century. We then may turn southward over *Combs Moss*, where there is a Roman camp, and by the sources of the Wye reaching Buxton, and thence back to Bakewell, through one of the most stupendous valleys in Derbyshire, which contains a succession of some of the most remarkable Tors and wild picturesque views imaginable. It is, in fact, a magnificent ride, sublimely grand at all seasons.
