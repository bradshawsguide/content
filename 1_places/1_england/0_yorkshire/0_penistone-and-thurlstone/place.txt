Text: This is a small market town, situated on the banks of the Don, in the midst of a wild and dreary district. It contains several large cotton and woollen factories, and a free *Grammar School*. Sanderson, the blind professor, was a native. Distant one mile lies *Thurlstone*, in which are fulling mills, and woollen and hair cloth manufactories.
