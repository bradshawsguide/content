Close at hand is *Bramhall House*, a fine timber residence of the 16th century, partly modernised. It contains portraits of Sir A. Legh, of Adlington who was at one time said to be Percy's hero, " Will you hear a Spanish lady," in his *Reliques*, but which applied to Sir J. Bolle, of Thorpe, who was present at the siege of Cadiz.
