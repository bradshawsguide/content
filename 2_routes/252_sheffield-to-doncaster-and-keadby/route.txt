(place: england/yorkshire/sheffield)

This line forms a communication from Sheffield with Barnsley, Doncaster, and Keadby. The first three miles of this is also over the Sheffield and Rotherham line; turning to the left at a place called Blackburn we pass the stations of [Grange Lane](/stations/grange-lane), [Chapeltown](/stations/chapeltown), [Westwood](/stations/westwood), [Birdwell](/stations/birdwell), [Dovecliffe](/stations/dovecliffe), and [Wombwell](/stations/wombwell), none of which need occupy much of the tourist's attention. At this point, a short branch runs in a westerly direction through [Ardsley](/stations/stairfoot) to

(place: england/yorkshire/barnsley)

There is also another branch from the same point running nearly parallel with that to Barnsley, through [Worsbrough](/stations/worsbrough), uniting the South Yorkshire with the Barnsley and Penistone branch at Silkstone.

Proceeding from Barnsley we pass the unimportant stations of [Wombwell](/stations/wombwell), [Wath](/stations/wath), [Mexborough](/stations/mexborough-junction) and [Conisborough](/stations/conisborough), and arrive at

(place: england/yorkshire/doncaster)

From Doncaster, we proceed through the stations of [Barnby Dun](/stations/barnby-dun), [Bramwith](/stations/bramwith), and [Stainforth](/stations/stainforth), at the latter of which is a canal excavated in 1793, fifteen miles in length, and having only two locks. The line then goes on to

(place: england/yorkshire/thorne)

[Maud's Bridge](/stations/mauds-bridge), [Godnow Bridge](/stations/godnow-bridge), and [Crowle](/stations/crowle) stations.

**Keadby**, a small town on the river Trent. A telegraph station.
