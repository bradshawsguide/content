Text:

This station being in a very deep cutting, much of the romantic scenery in the vicinity is concealed from view, but on issuing beyond we perceive a pretty villa on our left, and further on *Grange Hall* standing on a well wooded eminence near the railway. Near this place is an elegant bridge. Two miles beyond, is *Northwich*, *wich* (sounded witch), being the old name of a salt town
