Is a seaport town at the top of Loch Ryan, accessible to steamers of heavy tonnage; they only sail, however, about once a week to Glasgow and Belfast. The town itself has no particular attraction, but the country around is very interesting.

*Kennedy Castle*, 3Â½ miles to the east of the town, once the residence of the Earls of Cassilis, was destroyed by fire in 1715. A part of the walls are still remaining, and the grounds are kept in excellent condition.
