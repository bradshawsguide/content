On the castle site quarries of coal, stone, iron, &c., an alum work at Hurlet, and various old seats, as *Stanley Castle*, with its pillar cross, *Carndonald*, *Cochrane*, and *Elderslie*, which was Wallace's birthplace. The basalt rocks at the braes of Gleniffer are 760 feet high. Professor Wilson, the "Christopher North" of Blackwood's Magazine, and Tannahill the poet, were natives.

The ruins of the palace are worth a visit. In the vicinity are *Hawkshead*, Earl of Glasgow; *Horsehill*, T. Spiers, Esq.; *Railston*, J. Richardson, Esq.; *Crookstone* (where Queen Mary visited Darnley); *Oakshaw Head*, and Stewart's Raiss.
