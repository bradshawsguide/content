Text:

On leaving [Farringdon Street](/stations/farringdon-street) the line is carried across [Ludgate Hill](/stations/ludgate-hill) by means of a highly ornamented viaduct, and from thence over the Alexandra Bridge, a truly magnificent specimen of engineering skill, to [Blackfriars](/stations/blackfriars-bridge). The Charing Cross railway attracts our attention for a moment, when, on passing the station at [Borough Road](/stations/borough-road), we arrive at the well-known station of the

[Elephant and Castle](/stations/elephant-castle), from whence omnibuses may be had to almost every part of the metropolis.

[Wallworth Road](/stations/wallworth-road), [Camberwell Road](/stations/camberwell-road), and [Loughborough Road](/stations/loughborough-road) stations.

[Brixton](/stations/brixton).--The line used for the Crystal Palace traffic takes rather [a circuitous course](/routes/brixton-to-crystal-palace) eastward from this station.

On leaving Loughborough Road on our route from the city, we next come to [Herne Hill](/stations/herne-hill).
