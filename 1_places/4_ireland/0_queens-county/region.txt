Text:

Queen's County returns two members, in the eastern division of which the range of the Dysart Hills forms a prominent and picturesque object, rising in a detached group from the flat country by which they are surrounded. These hills command the view of a rich and beautiful country, adorned with extensive plantations and splendid demesnes. Considerable quantities of com are produced in this county, and large tracts of land are profitably appropriated to pasturage.
