Text:

(smcp: Kelso) is a market town (population about 4,783) in Scotland, which stands on the north side of the Tweed, opposite the junction of that river with the Teviot. It may be considered as the provincial capital of the surrounding fertile country, and noted for its manufacture of woollen tweeds, &c. Its inhabitants are polished, well-informed, and live in a style of considerable elegance, or rather luxury. The situation of the town is uncommonly beautiful It stands on the bank of a noble river, at the foot of that fertile tract of country which descends gradually from the heights of Lammermuir, and terminates on the borders of the Tweed. Here *Scott's Border Minstrelsy* was first published by Ballantyne, and in 1800 Rennie erected a noble five-arched bridge.

Nothing can be more beautiful than the scenery in this neighbourhood, when viewed from an eminence called Pinnacle Hill, on the southern bank of the river, from whence the country is seen to great advantage. The town lies in front, in a low valley. Immediately round it the country rises as if formed into terraces; cultivated fields, moods, and country seats, gradually ascend above each other, to the distance northwards of twelve or fourteen miles, forming an extensive landscape, which in richness and variety is scarcely to be equalled in Scotland.

The principal ornament of Kelso is its ancient abbey, founded by David I., and public library, the former of which suffered considerable damage during the Reformation, but was subsequently converted into a Protestant church. Close at hand are *Fleurs Castle*, the fine modern Gothic seat of the Duke of Roxburgh, and *Springwood*, Sir W. Douglas, Bart.
