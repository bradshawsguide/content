It contains the beautiful Percy screen, old sanctuary, quaint portraits of the founders, St. John of Beverley and King Athelstane, tombs of the patron saint and the "freed stool" for criminals to fly to. There is a good grammar school, at which the three bishops, Fisher (executed by Henry VIII.), Alcock who founded Jesus College, Cambridge), and Green were scholars, who, together with Alfred of Beverley and Mary Woolstonecroft were natives.
