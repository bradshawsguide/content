4Â½ miles from Kintore. To our right is *Kemnay House*, -- Burnett, Esq., and a little further on *Fetternear Castle*, the ancient seat of the Leslies, of Balquhain, Counts of the Holy Roman Empire, with Benachie -- the Ben Nevis of the district, looking across the finely wooded valley of the Don. In the neighbourhood stands the famous "Newton Stone," or "Maiden Stone," as it is locally named, with its as yet undecyphered characters. It has stood the summers' heat and the winters' winds of at least 2,000 years, and has puzzled all the scholars and philosophers of Europe.
