text: This little town stands prettily situated in the midst of a fine valley on the western banks of the Tavy. The hills in the vicinity are of a slaty character, and is the centre of an important mining district, which abounds with minerals of a varied and very valuable description. Portions of the ruins of a mitred abbey, founded in the 10th century, still remain, belonging to the Bedford family. Its racecourse, oval in shape, and 2 miles in circumference, is situated on Whitchurch Down, a little to the east of the town.
