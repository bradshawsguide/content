text: <span class="smcp">Beaumaris</span>, the capital of Anglesea, is beautifully situated at the entrance to the Menai Straits, about 4 miles from Bangor. It has remains of a castle, built in the thirteenth century by Edward I. The chapel and the great hall, 70 feet long, in which Queen Victoria (then princess) with the Duchess of Kent, her mother, attended an Eisteddfod or Bardic meeting in 1832, are still in a state of preservation. *Baron Hall* is the fine seat of Sir R. B. W. Bulkeley, Bart; in the grounds is the curious stone coffin of King John's daughter, Joan, named Llewellyn ap Jorworth, who founded a priory, of which there are remains at *Llanvaes*. Further on are *Penmon Priory* and the *Mona* (Mon is the Welsh name for Anglesea) *Marble Quarries*. Then *Puffin Island Light*, near which the *Rothesay Castle* steamer was wrecked in 1831, and 100 lives lost. Further on to the west there is a fine view from a large camp called *Bwrdd Arthur* or Arthur's Round Table.
