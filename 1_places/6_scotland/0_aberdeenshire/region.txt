Title: Aberdeenshire

Text:

Which is one of the most extensive counties in Scotland, and returns one member. It forms the north-east corner of the island, being the eastern most point of a large triangle, which juts out far into the German Ocean, and is circumscribed by lines running between Edinburgh, Inverness, and Peterhead. The greater part of it may be denominated a level plain, agreeably diversified by irregular depressions, and gently swelling slopes, forming a congeries of pleasing knolls, with vales between, each intersected by its little rill, so as to exhibit the scenery, the general appearance of which is tolerably uniform, though its particular features are varied at every step.
