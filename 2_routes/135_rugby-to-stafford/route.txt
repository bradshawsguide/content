From Rugby the line runs on an embankment, and crosses the river Avon on a viaduct, the arches of which are thirty feet span; it then passes over the Oxford canal, and through a very pretty country, crossing the north east section of the county of Warwick.

(place: england/warwickshire/bulkington)

(place: england/warwickshire/nuneaton)

(place: england/warwickshire/atherstone)

At Atherstone the line crosses the old coach road. *Atherstone Hall* is the seat of C. A. Bracebridge, Esq.

The park contains some of the finest old oaks in England. *Merevale*, the fine seat of W. Dugdale, Esq. descendant of the antiquary.

(place: england/warwickshire/polesworth)

On nearing Tamworth the fine old church is a noble object in the view; and the country round being rather pretty the effect is greatly increased. In the vicinity is *Grendon Hall*, Sir T. Chetwynd, Bart. On approaching Tamworth we again enter the county of Stafford.

As we approach Lichfield the magnificent and lofty spires of the Cathedral attract attention.

The old roadway passes under the line, which is on a lofty embankment. The station is of pleasing design, stone fronted, and has all the variety of outline so essential to the true spirit of the Tudor style of architecture. *Hagley Hall*, seat of Lady de la Zouche.

(place: england/staffordshire/colwich)

On nearing Stafford, the railway passes through a tunnel in *Shugborough Park*, seven hundred and seventy-nine yards in length. The north face of the tunnel is a very striking architectural composition. The lofty trees, clothed with the richest foliage, rising from the elevated ground through which the tunnel is pierced, give a depth of tone and artistic effect to the whole scene, a once peculiarly imposing and beautiful, and form a remarkably fine feature in the scenery of the railway. Emerging from the tunnel the town of Stafford is soon reached. *Wolsley Park* and *Bishton*, Miss Sparrows, are close at hand.
