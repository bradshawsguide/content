Text: (smcp: Pontefract), so called because of a broken bridge, near which is the keep of the Lacys' Castle, in which Richard II. was starved to death in 1899. Archbishop Scrope, executed by Henry IV.; Earls Rivers and Grey, by Richard III.; and the Duke of Orleans and other French prisoners were confined here after the battle of Agincourt. Here is a large old Gothic church, with a line picture of the crucifixion. Archbishop Bramhall, and Lund, the barber poet, were natives. Liquorice cakes are made here, the root being grown in the fields around Ackworth. Here the Quakers have an excellent school, in a healthy spot. Edward Sixth's Grammar School and Waterloo Pillar.
