Text: One and three quarter mile, a little to the right of which is the fine old seat of Sir T. C. Constable, Bart. In the church are the tombs of Stuteville, who built it and the tower in 1272, the Burtons of Hull-Bank House, with two brasses of a monk and priest. Once in every three years an intermitting spring flows here. The Castle is the seat of T. Thomson, Esa. Races annually.
