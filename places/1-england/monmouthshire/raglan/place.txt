text: Here are the fine remains of the castle built by Sir W. Thomas in the 14th century. The Marquis of Worcester defended it for four years against the Parliament: it is now a most picturesque ruin. It gives the title of Baron Raglan to a descendant--the late Lord Fitzroy Somerset, Commander-in- Chief in the late war in the Crimea. He was military secretary to Wellington, and lost an arm at Waterloo. What it was in the 16th century we may learn from the poet Churchyard; he speaks of it as--

> A castle fine
> That Raglan hight--stands moted almost round,
> Made of freestone, upright, straight as line,
> Whose workmanship in beauty doth abound.
