text: The face of this county is much varied; the fertile vale of Aylesbury spreads through the middle of the county, and furnishes a rich pasture to vast numbers of cattle. The natural fertility of this vale has been highly extolled, and is almost unrivalled. It lies between the Chiltern Hills and a parallel range of hills, running at a distance of only a few miles along the western side of Buckinghamshire.
