Text:

About a half a mile to the left of the station is *South Wingfield*, with the remains of its old Manor House, built in the reign of Henry II. Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned here for some time; it was ruined in the civil wars, and now its remains present some beautiful features. *Alfreton*, with its ancient church, lies 14 mile to the east of the station; the hall close by.
