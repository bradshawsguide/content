Text:

This is a small decayed borough, having a population of about 1,652, engaged principally as tin-workers--it has also a very limited export trade, *Kidwelly Castle* is here situated: it is reported to have been erected by William de Landres, a Norman adventurer, who conquered Glamorganshire about the year 1094. It now belongs to the Earl of Cawdor. The gateway is good, and altogether presents a noble relic of ancient magnificence. Here King John took refuge whilst at war with the barons.
