Title: Cambridgeshire

----

Text:

The whole of this extensive county is penetrated by artificial drains, and every exertion is made by the landed proprietors to redeem as much ground as possible from its former swampy condition. Cambridgeshire is remarkably flat, the great Bedford level alone containing 400,000 acres of land. The climate varies considerably. Cambridgeshire is an agricultural county; grain, hemp, flax, mustard seed, osiers, &c., are grown in great abundance.
