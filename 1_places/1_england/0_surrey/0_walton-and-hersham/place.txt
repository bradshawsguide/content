Text:

The Walton station is a short distance from Hersham, one mile to the left, and the same distance from Walton to the right. In the old church of St. Mary's, which may be seen rising amongst the trees, will be found various interesting monuments of considerable antiquity. A "scold bridle" is shown.

*Apps Court*, near Walton, was another of the many residences once belonging to Wolsey; and *Ashley Park*, the seat of the Fletcher family, is memorable for having been the temporary abode of Cromwell, prior to his assuming the Protectorate.
