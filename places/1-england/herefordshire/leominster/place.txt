text: This place has a population of 5,658, principally engaged in the manufacture of hats, leather gloves, and coarse cloth; it has also a considerable trade in wheat, wool, hops, and cyder. It has several free and national schools, meeting houses, and charitable institutions. Many of the buildings, which are of timber and plaster, grotesquely ornamented, present indications of the antiquity of the town. The buildings of greatest note are the church, rebuilt in the early part of the seventeenth century; the Butter Cross, erected about 1633, of timber and plaster, Market House, and House of Industry. This last formed part of a priory.
