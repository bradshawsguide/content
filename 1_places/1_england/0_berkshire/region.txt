text: This county is bounded by the counties of Oxford and Buckingham on the north, on the east by Surrey, on the south by Hampshire, and on the west by Wiltshire. A range of chalk hills, entering this county from Oxfordshire, crosses it in a westerly direction, and forms the southern boundary of the Yale of the White Horse. Independent of this range of hills, the county is characterised by gentle eminences and vallies, having much fertile land, and abounding with picturesque and beautiful scenery. Reading is the county town of Berkshire, and Windsor Castle its greatest ornament.
