One of the largest borough towns in the county of Northumberland. It stands on the northern bank of the river Tyne, and is a place of great antiquity. Newcastle has rapidly increased in its dimensions since the commencement of the present century; the town, if we include at least the adjoining suburbs, extends for nearly two miles along the river, and about one mile from the river towards the north and north west, rising along the hill, and crowning its summit. Its situation on the banks of a navigable river, and in the greatest coal district in the world, are the chief causes which have tended to raise it to wealth and importance.

There was a Roman station here, called *Pons Ælii*, on Hadrian's Wall, which began or ended at Segedunum or Coresin's House, and gives name to the Wall's End Coal. Before the conquest it was called Monkchester, which was altered when William built a new castle here, in place of one occupied by the Northumbrian king. This town, in 1354, when the port was made a staple for wool, &c., was styled, in the legal French of that day, *Neuf-Chastile-sur-Tyne*, and hence the modern name.

Though the channel of the Tyne is wide, deep, and sheltered, the larger collier ships remain at Shields, to which the coal is carried in barges or keels, by the keelmen, a rough and hardy set of people. Close to the river side, which rises abruptly from the long and excellent quay (⅓ mile long), the houses are in narrow alleys or chares, the seat of filth and disease, especially the cholera, which made great ravages here in 1853. This is old Newcastle, where all the business is carried on; but the new town, in St. Andrew's parish, in the higher parts, 200 feet or more above the river, is handsome and well laid out, having been planned by Grainger, an architect to whom the town is indebted for the Exchange (a half circle, about 150 feet long, with a glass dome, &c., and three Corinthian porticoes), Post Office (in the Arcade), Market, Music Hall, Hall of Incorporated Trades, Theatre Royal, and other buildings, many of which are built of solid, durable granite, at a cost of nearly two millions. The *County Courts*, on the site of the castle, in Carliol Square, built in 1810, by Stokoe, has a front 141 feet long, and Doric porticoes. Many Roman remains were uncovered in digging the foundation. Here are the gate, fine keep, 8O feet high (now a prison), and the beautiful Norman chapel, 16 feet long, of the old castle; the chapel being occupied by the Newcastle Antiquarian Society and their excellent museum. John Balliol did homage for his kingdom of Scotland to Edward L. in this castle, in 1292. The *Guildhall* was built in 165S, and is marked by a steeple, where a pair of crows built a nest in 1753. It contains the chamber of commerce, in which a fine oak mantelpiece, a statue of Charles II., and various portraits of sovereigns and natives, among whom are the tiro brothers, Lords Eldon and Stowell, who were born in Love Lane, near Forster Street, their father being a coal fitter, and Lord Collingwood. One piece of furniture in the mayor's room is the "branks or gag for scolds." The mayor is allowed £2,000 a year, a coach, barge, &c. The *Post Office* is a  handsome building, by Granger, with a front 100 feet long; the stamp, excise, and other offices are also under this roof.

The *Market House* is 210 feet long, and covers two acres of ground. At the elegant *Assembly Rooms* is Downman's picture of Falstaff and Mrs. Ford. There is also a coffee room and library. A *Philosophical* Society was founded in 1793; it has a good library, museum, &c., with busts of Dr. Hutton, the mathematician (a native, who died at Woolwich), and Bewick, the engraver-the latter by Bailey, the former by Chantrey. Another native mathematician was Edward Riddle, tho died in 1854, after a brief retirement from the Nautical School of Greenwich Hospital, entirely worn out by his indefatigable zeal to promote the character of that institution, which now occupies the first place in the kingdom as an institution of nautical science. To this many hundreds of officers in the naval and merchant services, trained under Mr. Riddle's eye, are alive to bear witness. In his early days he was Master of the Navigation School attached to the Trinity House here, founded in the l5th century.

The *Grammar School* was founded in 1525, by Horsley, a mayor of Newcastle. Here Bishop Ridley, and Akenside, the poet (who was born in Butcher Bank), Collingtrood, Eldon, &c., were educated. There is a *Cemetery* at Jesmond, or Jesus Mount Hill, over Ouse burn. The *General Infirmary* was commenced in 1751; there is also a separate hospital for the keelmen.

What is termed the *High Level Bridge*, is a splendid iron viaduct, 1,400 feet long, for the railway, across the river, above which it rises 112½ feet; and having, 32 feet below it, a common roadway, on six wide arches of 125 feet span. It crosses Dean Street by an arch 80 feet span and 80 feet high; and was built by the late R. Stephenson, the engineer of the line, whose great locomotive works, established by his father in 1824, are here, at which the Rocket, which gained the prize in 1829 on the Liverpool and Manchester line, was built. The old stone bridge, near Sand Hill, is on 9 arches, and formerly had houses along it, like London Bridge. Here stood the *Pons Ælii* of Hadrian, who belonged to the Elian family. It was immensely strong, but without springs for arches. Pandon Dean Bridge crosses a ravine on the east side of the town.

On a spot which the Roman wall passed over stands the old parish church of *St. Nicholas*, a Gothic cross, 240 feet long, built in 1359. It has a handsome pinnacled tower, above which is a flying steeple or lantern, supported by arches springing from the corners of the tower, making the whole 191 feet high. Wren built the tower of St. Dunstan-in-the-East near Thames Street, London, in this style, and eas rather proud of the work. Within are a choir, stalls, various monuments, the old font, large Flemish canopied brass of R. Thornton (dated 1429), tombs of the Percies and Moises (the latter by Flasman, and the epitaph by Lord Stowell. Cousins and Tomlinson's libraries, an illuminated Bible, 600 years old, and other books, are worthy of attention. On Shrove Tuesday the bell rings punctually at noon as a signal to the townspeople to fry pancakes. *St. Andrew's* and *St. John's* churches are both ancient, the former being Norman in its character; and there is an old crypt under *All Saints*, which was rebuilt in 17S3, on a circular plan, with a steeple 200 feet high. At the top of Grey Street is Bailey's statue of the first Earl Grey, on a column 136 feet high.

"The strength and magnificens of the waulling of this towne far passeth all the walles of the cities of England." According to Leland's account, it had I strong gates, and 17 towers in them for defence, one of which, New Gate, remains. Newcastle being an important frontier town great pains were taken to strengthen it. Many of the neighbouring barons had mansions here, such as the Percys, Nevilles, Scropes, and others; and there was a house provided for the Scottish kings over the Nungate. It is recorded of one of the Anderson family that, having dropped his ring over Newcastle Bridge, his servant bought a salmon a little while after, in which the ring was found. It is still in the possession of the family.

*Coal*, the true riches of Newcastle, was first. worked here in 1260, but the produce was scanty till steam power was used in 1714. Within a circle of 8 or 10 miles, more than 50 important collieries are open, among which are the Hetton, Hartley. Wallsend, and other familiar names, employing 10,000 to 15,000 hands, High-main coal is got from a rich bed 6 feet thick, nearly 200 fathoms beneath the surface. The great northern field, of which this is the centre, covers about 500 square miles in Northumberland and Durham, and may be 1,500 feet deep. Many and various calculations have been made by practical men and geologists as to the extent of supply, but all agree that it will take some hundreds, it not thousands, of years to exhaust it. At Painshaw and Monkwearmouth, near Sunderland, are mines 300 fathoms, or 1,800 feet, or ⅓ mile, deep, the deepest in England. The coal being brought to the water side, by truck or railway, is shot through staithes into the holds of vessels, or it is carried down the river in barges or keels, and then shovelled on board. The old collier ships are clumsy, "built by the mile," as sailors say, enough being cut off for a ship each time one is wanted; but they form a nursery of first-rate seamen. Of the three million tons sent to London, one million and upwards come from Newcastle. Latterly screw steamers have been put on to expedite the delivery in the metropolitan market, and a proposal for a coal railway has been favourably entertained.

The North Tyne rises in the Cheviots, and is joined by the South Tyne at Hexham. There is nothing very striking in the scenery up of down it. Below Newcastle its banks are lined with collieries, foundries, glass and chemical works, and such like, all the way to North and South Shields and Tyne-mouth. At South Shields may be seen, in the church, a model of Greathead's first life boat, invented and used in 1790. Tynemouth has the fue remains of an important priory, and a monument in Lord Collingwood. Above Newcastle, and to the west of the rail to Carlisle, are several traces of the famous Picts' Wall, also called Hadrian's, and by other names, and nearly 700 miles long from sea to sea. There were, in fact, two or three walls or lines, in the military sense, built between the first and third centuries by the Roman conquerors of Britain to secure themselves from the troublesome savages beyond; the first tiro, by Agricola and Hadrian, were earthworks, and the third only, by Severus, was of stone; they were 10 to 12 feet high, and proportionately thick, with ditches, towers, &c., and 18 principal stations along the whole, ot which 10 were in Northumberland. Two of these, Walwick Chestus and Housestead, still yield much information to the "painful" antiquary.

Other objects near Newcastle are the following:--*Wylam*, the birthplace of George Stephenson (father of Robert), in 1780. From this he went to Killingworth mines, belonging to Lord Ravensworth, and there showed his great mechanical genius, among other things by inventing a locomotive engine for the tram way in 1814, and a safety lamp jn 1815, independent of Davy's, with which it was tried, and found to do as well. Here also he made his improvements on railways, which he carried out in 1821-5, on the Stockton and Darlington line, 22 miles long, and memorable as the first locomotive rail in England. The second was the more important, Liverpool and Manchester, opened in September, 1830.

*Ravensworth Castle* (5 miles) the large modern seat of Lord Ravensworth, rebuilt in 1803; some parts of the old house are preserved. *Oxwell Park* (4 miles), Sir T. Clavering, Bart., on the Derwent, which joins the Tyne at Derwent Haugh, lower down. The country is hilly towards its source in the Allendale Hills.
