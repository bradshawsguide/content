(smcp: Wolverton), near the river Ouse, has an increasing population of 2,370, chiefly dependent on the London and North Western Railway Company, who have a depot and extensive factories here. It is also a refreshment station. A new church and market house, and hundreds of model cottages, have been built by the Company, whose works cover 12 acres of ground. While Crewe is the nursery, Wolverton is the hospital for locomotives. There are the worn-out, the ricketty, the accidents, and sundry other wards, in all of which locomotives are to be seen undergoing cure. Red hot pieces of iron are being forcibly administered; holes probed and nuts screwed on them; steam lathes are facing down callosities; hundreds of locomotive surgeons— stalwart and iron-fisted—dress and bind up cases in their wards with a tremendous energy. Sickly-looking locomotives are fitted up with bran new outsides; several in the last stages of collapse have strong doses of copper rivets forced into their systems. Metal giants, shaky about the knees, are furnished with new sets of joints. In the most desperate cases a cure is effected. Ninety-nine out of every hundred of these battered patients come out perfectly restored to their bereaved stokers. By the help of a blast furnace and steam hammer, even the most incurable is beaten young again, and reproduced as a new locomotive, called perhaps the "Phoenix."—(*Household Words*, 1853.) Nothing is wasted here, for the scraps are welded together in the furnace, for axles or cranks, or any other duty requiring temper and strength. The metal cutting and planing works deserve notice.
