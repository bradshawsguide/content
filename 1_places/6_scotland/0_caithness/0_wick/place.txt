Wick is about 8,000; the number of electors 330, and the population of the parish about 14,000. Some very fine buildings have been recently built, particulady a new church and new court house at an expense of upwads of £10,000.

The exports of the district are chiefly herrings (which are caught to the value of £200,000), cod, salmon, cattle, sheep, pork, eggs (of which about 8,000,000 are yearly exported), paving stones (the finest in the kingdom), lobsters, &c. Were the line of railway extended to Wick, it could supply the fish markets of the kingdom with an immense quantity of the finest fish in season within 24 hours after being caught. The population of the county has doubled within the last 40 years, and the rental has risen from £35,000 to £120,000.
