title: Westmorland
----
text: The name of which county is descriptive of its nature, that is the West-moor-land, a region of lofty mountains, naked hills, and bleak barren moors. The vallies through which the rivers flow are tolerably fertile; and in the, north-eastern quarter there is a considerable tract of cultivated land. The south-western side is fertile, with a warmer climate. These two sides, of the county are divided, by lofty, fells and extensive moors, intersected with pastoral vales. The.climate is exceedingly humid, owing to its contiguity to the western ocean, from which the winds blow at least two-thirds of the year, and with them a quantity of moisture, which afterwards falls in the form of rain. The atmosphere is, however, pure and healthy.
