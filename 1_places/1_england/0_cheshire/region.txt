text: The general appearance of which, about fifty miles long and twenty-five broad, is that of an extensive plain, but on the eastern side there is a range of mountainous country connected with the Derby and Yorkshire hills, rather more than 20 miles in length. On the Shropshire side the country is also broken and irregular. This county has been called the Vale Royal of England; and when viewed from the high land above Macclesfield, it has the appearance of a beautiful plain, watered by many large rivers. It has long been celebrated for the excellence of its cheese, of which more than 20,000 tons are annually sent to London, besides the various other places at which it finds a market.
