Here is a curious old church, which has recently undergone considerable improvements and decorations. The curious old Norman chapel, distinct from the church, is appropriated as a Nationals and Sunday school. In 1808, tumuli, urns, and human bones were found here. In the vicinity are *Adlington Hall*, seat of C. Legh, Esq., which was besieged for a fortnight by the parliamentarians *Butley Hall*, W. Brocklehurst, Esq.; *Mottram Park* Rev. H. Wright; *Styperson Park*; *Shrigley Hall*, Rev. B. Lowther.
