Text:

This is a line of about nine miles, and passes through [Earlsmill](/stations/earlsmill), [Auchindachy](/stations/auchindachy), and [Drummuir](/stations/drummuir), to the little village of

[Dufftown](/stations/dufftown), situated on the river Spey, at the foot of a range of hills, the principal and centre of which is Beurinnes, which rises to the height of about 2,700 feet. A little further south lies *Glenlivet*, the scene of Argyll's defeat, when he fought against the Catholic leaders.

A short line to the right unites this place with [the Morayshire railway at Strathspey](/routes/keith-to-inverness-and-invergordon).
