This romantic little town of Westmorland is in the Vale of Brathay, among the mountains at the head of Windermere, from which it is about a mile distant; and is an excellent centre for excursions, short and long, in the Lake District.

Coaches run to the station at Windermere, three times a day, fare one shilling; the distance being four to five miles, amidst fine trees and beautiful scenery. There are also coaches to Grasmere, Keswick, and Cockermouth, from the terminus.

In the immediate vicinity of Ambleside are the following:â€”- *Skockgill Force*, a splendid waterfall, 150 feet down, on the stream which rises in the Kirkstone fells, and runs through Ambleside. *Wansfell Pike* is seen as you look up it. This and Skelgill are easily ascended, but Fairfield, 2,950 feet high, is more fatiguing -- the prospect from which is however magnificent Another easy point of view is *Loughrigg Fell*, 1,050 feet above the lake. At the foot of Loughrigg is *Fox Howe*, the residence of the late esteemed Dr. Arnold.
