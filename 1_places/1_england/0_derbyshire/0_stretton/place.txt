In the vicinity is *Ogston Hall*, seat of G. Turbut, Esy. Two and a half miles to the left is *Ashover*, in a deep valley on the Amber; near it, on the Common, is a rocking-stone, 26 feet in circumference, called Robin Hood's mark, and near this a singularly shaped rock, supposed to have been a rock idol. At *Lea*, in the parish, is an ancient chapel in ruins. At *Overton*, Sir Joseph Banks lived. Close by is Eastwood Hall, once the residence of the Reresby family; the remains evince a structure of much importance; it has a modern mansion attached to its shattered walls, and stands at the foot of a high hill, which is covered with huge rocky masses and crowned with a pine forest.
