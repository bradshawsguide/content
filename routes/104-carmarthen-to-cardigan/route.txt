text: This line runs hence to the northward through [Bronwydd Arms](/stations/bronwydd-arms), [Conwyl](/stations/conwyl), and [Llanpumpsaint](/stations/llanpumpsaint), to the town of [Pencader](/stations/pencader), from which place the Manchester and Milford carries the traffic northward a distance of 12Â¾ miles, the only portion of the line completed through [Maesycrygian](/stations/maesycrugiau) and [Llanybyther](/stations/llanybyther), to [Lampeter](/stations/lampeter), and from thence by coach to *Aberavron* and *Aberystwith*. Beyond Pencader the Cardigan line runs only at present to [Llandyssil](/stations/llandyssil), from whence there is a coach once a day to [Newcastle Emlyn](/stations/newcastle-emlyn), a considerable market, town, prettily situated in a bend of the river Teifi, which here forms the boundary line between the counties of Carmarthen and Cardigan. The same coach runs through to the watering place and county town of

**[Cardigan](/stations/cardigan)**, situated on the northern bank of the Teifi. The remains of an old castle, built by the Norman barons about the end of the eleventh century are visible.
