(smcp: Athole House), the residence of the late lamented  Duke ot Athole, is close at hand; was visited by the  Queen in the Autumn of 1363, in sympathy for the  Duke under his afflictions, who lived only a very  few weeks after. The town and neighbourhood are held in great reputation by tourists generally.
