Here is a cruciform church with a fine spire, and from which a most magnificent view is obtained of the Humber--and a model farm of 1,000 acres, the property of Mr. Marshall, of Leeds. Population, 1,724. At *Welwich* is a pretty church.

About 11 miles south south east is *Spurn Head*, a low  sandy point at the Humber's mouth, which Ptolemy called *Ocellum Promontorium*, from *ocellus*, an eye, which is its shape now. Near this place, in 1682, James II. (then Duke of York) was wrecked on his way to Scotland, when himself, his priests, dogs, and the Great Duke of Marlborough, were fortunately saved. The lights upon it were built by Smeaton.
