## Wandsworth to Barnes
The Richmond line properly branches off about the point where the road to the village of Battersea leaves the Wandsworth road, and at a short distance from Battersea. It then pursues a pretty course through the villas, orchards, and nursery gardens which stud that locality, till it reaches Wandsworth. The river Wandle and the valley are crossed by a splendid viaduct.

(place: england/surrey/wandsworth)

On leaving Wandsworth we have for a moment a picturesque peep at the Thames, and the line pursues a southerly direction through a deep cutting of some extent, until we reach

(place: england/surrey/putney)

On emerging from the cutting and passing this station, we proceed over a level country to Barnes Common, which the line crosses.

(route: barnes-to-hounslow-and-feltham)

## Barnes to Windsor
A great portion of the line is but a few feet above the natural surface of the country, and many of the roads are crossed on a level. The country through which it passes does not present many picturesque views, the property almost throughout being circumscribed by orchards and market gardens. The want, however, of the beautiful along the line is amply compensated by the lovely views in the neighbourhood of Richmond; and from Richmond to Datchet there is a succession of splendid scenery.

The first station at which we arrive is

(place: england/surrey/mortlake)

The remainder of our course to Richmond lies through fields and gardens, catching a glimpse of Kew Gardens, and the Pagoda on our right, and passing some prettily built almshouses, and a castellated building used as a barracks; also, on our right, we come to the station in Kew road, at

(place: england/surrey/richmond)

The line crosses the Thames over the railway bridge at Richmond--a very handsome structure of three arches.

  A line of railway here turns off to the left, and running through the village of [Teddington](/stations/teddington), passes along the side of the Thames on the one hand and *Bushey Park* on the other to [Hampton Wick](/stations/hampton-wick), and

(branch: start)
  The Thames Valley railway from Twickenham cuts off a small part of the county of Middlesex in passing the station of [Fulwell](/stations/fulwell) to [Hampton](/stations/hampton), on the north bank of the Thames, a little to the right of which is *Kenton Park*, once the seat of royalty, now the residence of T. Manners, Esq. Skirting the river to our left, we pass the station of [Sunbury](/stations/sunbury), and thence to [Shepperton](/stations/shepperton), on the Thames, where good fishing may be obtained.
