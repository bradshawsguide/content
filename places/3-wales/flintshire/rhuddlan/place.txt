text: The town is situated on the eastern bank of the river Clwyd. Below it is *Rhuddlan Castle*, the ruins of which have a noble and imposing appearance from every point of view. The historical reminiscences connected with this fortress are of great interest, but too voluminous and ancient for our general readers. It was built by Llewellyn in 1015, and dismantled in 1646. In the church are tombs of Dean Shipley and the Conways. A mile from the castle is *Pengwern*, the seat of Lord Mostyn, most delightfully situated in the vale of Clwyd.
