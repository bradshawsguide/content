Close to this place is *Goldsborough Hall*, the seat of the Earl of Harewood; *Ribston Hall*, the old residence of the Goodrickes, at which the Ribston Pippin was first cultivated, and the Knights Templars had a preceptory. The Roman inscription found at York in the 17th century is carefully preserved here.
