Text: Near this place is *Fulwell*, where a skeleton 9½ feet long was found in 1750. At *Southwick* are remains of a monastery, founded by St. Bega, and refounded in 671, by Biscopias (who first brought glass into use in this country). It was burnt by the Danes in 793, and by the Scots in 1083. At *Monkwearmouth* Pit is the largest shaft in England, being 292 fathoms deep. The *Church* contains effigies of the Filtons, and remains of the monastery at which the venerable Bede was a monk. Here Paley was some time rector.
