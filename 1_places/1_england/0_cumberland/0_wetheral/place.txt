Text:

Pleasantly situated on the Eden, with its old church, in which is Nolleken's beautiful monument of Mrs Howard, of Corby, and effigies of the Salkelds and Howards. There is a pretty walk to *Wetheral Safeguards*, or *St. Constantine's* three caves, the Hermitage, and Folly summer-house, from which a most magnificent view may be obtained. The gate of the *Priory*, founded by Randulph de Meschines, in 1088, is in a beautiful state of preservation. On the left is Warwick Hall, the seat of Mrs. Parker, close to an old chinch and cotton factory.
