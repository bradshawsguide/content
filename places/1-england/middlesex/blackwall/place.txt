text: There is a fine pier here, whence packets run to and from Gravesend, in conjunction with the trains of the Blackwall railway. Fine views of the shipping in the river, Greenwich, Isle of Dogs, and the country round. Opposite the pier is Shooter's Hill with its commemorative castle of Severndroog, built in 1784 by Sir William Jones, the celebrated Orientalist, to celebrate the conquest of a castle thus named on the coast of Malabar. White-bait dinners form the chief attraction to the taverns adjacent; and here Her Majesty's ministers for the time being regale themselves annually on that fish; the season is from May to the latter end of July, when parliament generally closes for the season.
