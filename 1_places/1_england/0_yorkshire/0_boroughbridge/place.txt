Text: This place was the scene of a battle in 1321, when the Earl of Lancaster was routed by Edward II. The *Crown Inn* here was once the seat of the Tancreds. Close to the stone bridge are three Druidical Stones, named the *Devil's Arrows*. Close at hand is *Aldoborough*, the ancient *Isurium*, where old walls, coins, and pavements have been found.
