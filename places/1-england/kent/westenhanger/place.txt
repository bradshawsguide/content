text: Near this is the old baronial seat, some say the kingly palace, of Westenhanger, once the residence of the ill-fated Fair Rosamond. The remains are probably of the period of Edward III., and but poorly represent their pristine grandeur. Two miles north is *Monk's Horton Priory*, and a short distance beyond, *Lyminge Church*; two miles to the east, *Beachborough Park*, and three miles to the south-east is [Hythe](hythe).
