text: The pretty village of this name is situated to the eastward of the line, but is not in view.

Soon after leaving this station we reach the Arpley embankment, and pass over the Mersey Viaduct. This, though less grand in appearance than the Dutton Viaduct, is a fine work, consisting of twelve arches, through three of which the river Mersey, and the Mersey and Irwell canal pass. The valley of the Mersey is spread before us, and on each side the scenery is very beautiful, consisting principally of rich pasture land, adorned with farm-houses and cottages.

A short, distance beyond this the river winds towards the town of Warrington, with its manufactory chimneys, large buildings, and churches, &c.
