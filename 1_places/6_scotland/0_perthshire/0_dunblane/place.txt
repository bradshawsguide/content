Text:

This city, though it has only a village population is well worth visiting. The Cathedral is much admired, and in good preservation. It has a mineral spring, to which many visitors resort during the summer months. Tannahill's beautiful song of "Jessie, the flower of Dunblane," has given it popularity. The Allan runs through the village. A beautiful foot road by the river side runs between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan.
