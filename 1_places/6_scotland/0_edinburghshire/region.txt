The principal part of this county, which returns one member, is mountainous. To the eastward of Edinburgh the country is agreeably variegated, by being formed, at the distance of every two or three miles, into ridges, in a direction from south to north, the whole of which are well cultivated. Each ridge, proceeding to the east, is more lofty than the former, till it terminates in the hills of Lammermoor.

Towards the north, that is, upon the coast, the face of the country is rich and beautiful; but on receding from the sea, it gradually loses that aspect, and the mountains are bleak, naked, and barren on the south and south-west.

The rivers belonging to this county are of no importance from their magnitude, but they are rendered interesting by the beautiful scenery exhibited almost everywhere upon their steep woody banks.

The North and South Esk have beautiful wooded banks, adorned with splendid villas of the nobility or gentry. It rises on the southern side of the Pent-land Hills, above Newhall, about 14 miles from Edinburgh, and its banks are not only uncommonly romantic and beautiful, but they form a species of classic ground.

The eastern division of this county contains one of the most extensive and rich fields of coal that is anywhere to be found; but notwithstanding the abundance of the coal, the seams being of great thickness, the mines have generally proved unprofitable, in consequence of the enormous expense of working them, from the seams running to great depths.

The maritime traffic of the county, which is very considerable, is concentrated in Leith, which possesses the best port in the county. The navigable canal and various lines of railway proceeding from Edinburgh to the rest of Scotland, makes the capital of this county the entrep√¥t of import as well as of export goods.
