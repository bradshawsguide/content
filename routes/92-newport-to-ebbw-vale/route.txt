text: The Eastern and Western Lines turn off at this point to the right, passing through districts rich in mineral products, but not of essential importance to the general tourist. The first station on the Western Line is [Bassalleg Junction](/stations/bassaleg-junction); and here the Rhymney and Newport section of the Brecon Line branches off to the left, skirting the boundary of the country, passing the Stations of [Rhiwderin](/stations/rhiwderin), [Church Road](/stations/church-road), [Machen](/stations/machen), [Bedwas](/stations/bedwas), and [Maesycwmmer](/stations/maesycwmmer), to [Pengam](/stations/pengam), and from thence to [Bargoed](/stations/bargoed), [New Tredegar](/stations/new-tredegar), and [Rhymney](/stations/rhymney).
