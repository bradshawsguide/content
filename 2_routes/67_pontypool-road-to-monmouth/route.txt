Text:

About a mile and a half beyond Pontypool Road, at a place called Little Mill, this line turns off; and at the distance of about 3Â½ miles further, we cross the river Usk, and stop at the station of that name.

(place: england/monmouthshire/usk)

Passing [Llandenny](/stations/llandenny) Station, we arrive at [Raglan Road](/stations/raglan-road), about two miles along the high road to the town, [Raglan Footpath](/stations/raglan-footpath), about one mile to the left to Raglan, but available only to pedestrians.
