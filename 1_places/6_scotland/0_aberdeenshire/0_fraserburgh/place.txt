This is a respectable and flourishing seaport town, in a parish of that name; 151 miles north-east of Edinburgh, 42 north-east of Aberdeen, 22 east of Banff, and 18 north-west of Peterhead; situated on the south side of Kinnaird Head, which is a bold promontory, surmounted by a lighthouse.

The parish occupies the north-eastern angle of land in this part of the county, and extends about 3½ miles each way. Fraserburgh is a burgh of barony and royalty of old called Faithly, conform to king James's Charter, dated 1st July, 1592, and Charter of Erection, dated 13th February, 1613. It is governed by a provost, baillies, and 13 town councillors Lord Saltoun is hereditary provost or chief magistrate, but in consequence of his absence, the Baron Baillie acts under a commission from him as chief magistrate. By this charter considerable powers are vested in the proprietor, Sir Alexander Fraser. The rental ot the town of Fraserburgh is conform to last valuation under the valuation of Lands Act, £7,610 4s. 6d. An excellent market place was constructed along with the new town house, a magnificent edifice, which was built by the town in 1855.

There is an excellent harbour, which has been improved very much of late years, under powers granted by an Act of Parliament, 2nd and 3rd Vic, cap. 65. It is managed by the magistrates and town council, and five fenars, who are appointed commissioners for executing the Act. Up to 1846 £25,702 4s. 7d had been expended on the harbour. Since that time a new harbour has been constructed, containing an area of eiht acres, and offering a frontage for berthing of 2,110 feet, making with the former berth, ge, viz., 2,900, an aggregate of 5,010 feet.

Contiguous to the harbour is a tolerable rod for shipping, in a bay nearly three miles in length, and upwards of one in breadth, with good anchorage ground, which affords capital shelter to vessels bound southward, in the event of stormy weather, and the wind being contrary. The herring fishing is prosecuted to a great extent at Fraserburgh, and there are generally from 200 to 300 boats engaged in this vocation each year. The general fishing is begun about 20th July, and continues for eight weeks. It is supposed that about 3,296 persons are employed as fishermen, coopers, gutters, packers, and labourers ^besides 745 employed in gathering bait and making and mending nets, and 123 in vending fish, making in all 4,164 persons.
