Text:

We now begin to perceive a distinct stream of the Clyde, which shortly after issuing from its source, from the accession of many tributary burns, becomes at this point, a river of considerable size, and keeps gradually increasing --

> Now sunk in shades, now "bright in open day,
> Bright Clyde, in simple beauty, wends his way.
