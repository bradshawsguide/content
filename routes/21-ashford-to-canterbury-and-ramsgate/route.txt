text: At [Ashford](/stations/ashford), the line branches off to Canterbury, Whitstable, Sandwich, Deal, Ramsgate, and Margate, and, from the accommodation it affords to the towns through which it passes, and the exquisite beauty of the scenery along its route, will not suffer in comparison with any line of similar length in the kingdom. It follows throughout the meanderings of the river Stour, and traversing the most fertile district in the country, has one uninterrupted panorama of luxuriant fertility during its whole length.

Emerging from a tolerably deep cutting, we next trace to the left a most charming and picturesque village, and shortly reach

Thence the windings of the Stour, spanned ever and anon by some rustic bridge of wood or stone, enhances the romantic beauty of the landscape, and we seem to be for many miles treading the sylvan labyrinth of a miniature Rhine-land.

From Sturry the main line proceeds in an east-north-east direction, through a highly cultivated country, and enters the Isle of Thanet, near Grove Ferry, where the railway crosses the Wausum, and, proceeding five miles further, reaches the Minster Junction Station, whence [a branch line](/routes/minster-junction-to-deal) diverges to the ancient towns of Sandwich, and Deal, and the other, the main line, proceeds to Ramsgate and Margate.

From Minster to Ramsgate the line on a tolerably steep incline.

Kent and the Kentish coast have long been celebrated for their delicious climate and exquisite pastoral scenery, and the railway passes through a fine panorama of marine and picturesque views, until it reaches
