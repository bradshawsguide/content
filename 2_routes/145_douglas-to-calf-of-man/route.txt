(place: isle-of-man/douglas)

Past the Nunnery, &c., to

*Kirk Santon*, or *Kirk St. Ann*, near a Druid circle. Thence to Ballasalla, Kirk Malew, and Castletown, and round Balvash bay, past Kirk Christ, Rushen, (near Breda copper mine) to

*Port-le-Murry*, *i.e.*, Maryport, a little fishing place, with lime quarries in the cliffs, which at Spanish Head are 300 feet high, and broken into deep chasms. Here, it is said, one of the ships of the Spanish Armada was wrecked.

The south-west extremity of the island is bounded by barren dark slate cliffs sloping to the water, and separated by a narrow but angry channel from the *Calf of Man*, which is a tall green looking rock, 2 miles long, swarming with rabbits and solan geese. Some attempts hare been made by the owner (C. Carey, Esq.) to introduce the turnip culture. There are two lights on it, 305 and 396 feet high. At the north corner of it is a little rock called the Kitterland. Boats may be had to cross the channel when the sea is moderate. A passage ship was wrecked near this part in 1853. Cæsar calls this island Mona, a name also applied to Anglesey. The Maux name is *Mannin*, which some explain to mean "Stone Island"—or "Meadhon-in-(Middle Island)."
