Text: Lies about six miles to the north - east of Skipton, most charmingly situated on the banks of the river Wharfe. Indeed, the picturesque character of this and the surrounding districts peculiarly striking and impressive. The priory was originally founded in 1121, at Embsay, by Willian de Meschines, but afterwards removed to its present situation by his daughter Adeliza, in memory of the loss of her son, who, in attempting to cross the "Strid," a chasm in the rock through which the Wharfe rushes, about a mile from the abbey, was fearfully precipitated and drowned. The Duke of Devonshire has a hunting seat formed out of one ot the entrances to the abbey.
