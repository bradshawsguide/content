text: One of the most nourishing little towns in Cornwall. There are quays affording accommodation for vessels of 300 tons burthen. On the north side of Hayle creek is *St. Phillack Church*, half buried in sand, which here forms immense hills, in some instances 60 feet high. A mile or two beyond are the remains of an ancient church at *St. Gwythian*, which had laid buried in the sand for centuries.
