Text: This is the junction of a short line to Gretna and the Ayrshire lines. The town stands on the east bank of the river Esk, crossed at this point by the railway, and a neat bridge of five arches leading to it. It was founded by the Grahams, of Netherby Hall, situated about a mile to the north of the town. Farming improvements have here been made on a large scale.
