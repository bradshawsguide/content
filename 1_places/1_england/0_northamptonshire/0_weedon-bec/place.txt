text: This village is divided into Upper and Lower Weedon; the latter is bisected by the railway, and the former lies at a short distance on the left. The military depot is a magnificent establishment, and is capable of containing 240,000 stand of small arms. Four miles west of this station is the ancient town of Daventry.

*Daventry*, near the Nene's Head, and noted for its shoe manufacture, is situated on a gentle eminence near the source of the rivers Avon and Nene. It formerly possessed a rich priory, which Henry VIII. gave to Wolsey, the ruins of which are still visible. From Borough Hill, in the vicinity, there is a delightful prospect of Naseby, Northampton, Weedon, and Coventry, and this beautiful landscape is rendered peculiarly picturesque by the remains of a Roman encampment and ramparts in the foreground.
