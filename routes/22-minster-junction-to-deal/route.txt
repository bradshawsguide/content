text: After leaving [Minster](/stations/minster-junction), the line crosses the Stour by a double swing bridge built on a new and ingenious principle. Each line has its bridge; one turns to the right on a pivot on the side of the Minister branch, and the other to the left, from a pivot on the side of Ash, which is the next parish. By this arrangement greater stability is obtained, with a nicer power of adjustment. This bridge is considered a curiosity by engineers, and it will well repay examination. It far surpasses the celebrated bridge at Norwich.

The line then proceeds over Sandwich flats past the hamlet of Saltpans. At this spot the memorable ruins of Richborough come fully into sight; and shortly after the train sweeps round the sandy hill on which they stand. This was a celebrated Roman station, which guarded the southern entrance of the great Roman haven, the area of which is now in the hands of agriculturists, and <q>*Corn now waves where Caesars once bore sway*.</q> The remains of a Roman amphitheatre are still very apparent. In the centre of the great quadrangle is the celebrated prostrate cross, built to commemorate the introduction of Christianity into England. It is placed on the top of an immense heathen altar, and marks the spot on which Augustin preached the gospel No monument in the kingdom equals this simple cross in interest, yet few have been treated with greater neglect. We commend it to the care of the clergy of Canterbury, the successors of Augustin and his eighty monks.
