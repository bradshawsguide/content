Text:

This county, from its numerous objects of antiquity, geographical situation on the German Ocean, as well as its seaport towns, seats, agricultural and manufacturing products, is particularly deserving of notice.

In the fenny part of the country the air is not only cold, but exceedingly damp; but the counts to the north and north-west of Thetford, forming the greater part of Norfolk, consisting of a sandy or gravelly soil, is peculiarly salubrious and pleasant.

The manufactures of Norfolk, which consist almost exclusively of woollen goods, are nearly all centred in the city of Norwich and its vicinity. Yarmouth and Lynn are the two principal ports, from which nearly all the manufactured goods are exported.
