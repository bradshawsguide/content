Is a royal burgh of considerable antiquity, and one of the cluster of six which returns a member to Parliament. It is pleasantly situated, and has a good view of Eastern Sutherland and of Cromarty. Weekly grain markets are held here, and there is a rich agricultural district around the town, Easter Ross being famous for its large and early crop*.
