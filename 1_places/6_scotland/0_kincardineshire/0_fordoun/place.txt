Near which Montrose took up his position on the eve of the battle at Kilsyth. The church, which was rebuilt, is near Luther Water, a pretty spot; here are two Roman camps, 249 feet, and a British one close to Drumsleid. The mineral springs are considered good. The learned and eccentric lawyer, Lord Monboddo, was a native. Fordoun, the author of the *Scotichronicon*, was a monk here; and Beattie kept a school until his advancement. Three miles beyond is the now insignificant village of Kincardine, which was the capital of that county until James VI.'s time, where are the ruins of Kenneth III.'s Castle, who was killed at Fettercairn.
