Text: A market town in the county of Cambridge, with a population of 4,069, long celebrated in the annals of horsemanship for its extensive heath, in the immediate vicinity of which has been formed one of the finest race-courses in the kingdom. The principal part of Newmarket is situated in Suffolk; but the whole of the race course, on whose attractive charms its support mainly depends, is in Cambridgeshire. Most of the houses are modern and well built; and many of them, which have been erected as residences for the nobility and private gentlemen who attend the races, are extremely handsome. The church contains a tomb to Frampton, trainer to Queen Anne and George I. and II. Bishop Merks, and Harewood the physician, were natives.
