Text:

This city, which has not aptly been termed the "modern Athens," is one of the most ancient in this country. Its schools for the acquirement of useful knowledge have long held a high rank amongst the universities of Europe, and have supplied some of the most distinguished statesmen, warriors, poets, and divines, who have graced our annals.

It contains beauties and peculiarities which give it a high claim to attention amongst the capitals of Europe, and is the capital of Scotland in a superb situation on the north slope of the Pentland Hills, fronting the Firth of Forth, two miles from it. Two members returned.

(smcp: Edinburgh), so called from Edwin, king of Northumbria, tho built a castle here in the seventh century, while others claim the origin from the two Gaelic words, "Dun Edin," which signifies "the face of a hill." It covers a space of from two to two and a half miles square. and contains the old town on the east between the Castle, Holyrood Palace, and the Abbey; the south town, round Heriot's Hospital, Newington, and Morningside; and the new town on the north and north-west. Both the south and new towns have been erected within the last hundred years; the latter especially, comprises many noble streets and squares, built of the beautiful stone from Craigleith quarry (two miles distant from the city). In the old town, along the High Street, Canongate, Grassmarket, &c., many houses are of Queen Mary's time, divided by narrow dark closes (or alleys), and from six to ten stories (or flats) high. Between it and the new town are east and west Princes Street Gardens, beautifully laid out, and through which the Edinburgh and Glasgow, and North British railways pass; this was formerly called the North or Nor' Loch, a sheet of stagnant water; there are the North and Waverley bridges, and Mound, forming a connection with the old and new town. Of the numerous fine structures which adorn the "Modern Athens," as it has been styled from a similarity in its general appearance, the

**Castle** on a hill, 383 feet above the level of the sea, is surmounted by modern batteries, the state prison and arsenal, Queen Mary's room (where she gave birth to James VI.), the regalia room (*admittance free by order from City Chambers*); among the regalia are Bruce's Crown and Sceptre. Mons Meg, a large cannon, said to be cast at Mons, in Brittany, in 1426, is mounted on a carriage on the Bomb Battery. The Queen and Prince Albert ascended it for the view in 1842. The castle ought to be visited an account of the magnificent prospect it affords; on the north side of the castle esplanade is a statue to the *Duke of York*. *College of Justice*, in Parliament Square, where the 13 judges sit, where are statues of President Forbes, Blair, Lord Melville, Dundas, and the late Lord Jeffrey; adjoining is the *Advocates' Library*, containing nearly 20,000 printed volumes, and 1,700 manuscripts. Among the MSS. is a Bible of the 11th century, and the original Solemn League and Covenant. *Signet Library* is peculiarly rich in the department of History, especially British and Irish. In the centre of the square is a *Statue of Charles II.*, on horseback. *General Post Office*, in Waterloo Place, a Grecian building. *Stamp and Excise Offices*, in Waterloo Place. *General Register House*, Princes Street (foot of North Bridge), a handsome Grecian pile, with a tower 200 feet high; immediately in front is the *Equestrian Statue of the Duke of Wellington*, by Steel. *Nelson's Monument*, on Calton Hill, 102 feet in height-on the top is a *Time Ball*, which is lowered at one o'clock, Greenwich time. *National Monument*, on Calton Hill, *unfinished*, consists of 12 great pillars, and erected at a cost of £13,000; it is a model of the Parthenon of Athens. Close by are monuments to Dugald Stewart and Professor Playfair, and the *Royal Observatory*, shaped like a St. George's Cross, 62 feet lung: *Scott's Monument*, in East Princes Street Gardens, one of the finest ornaments of Edinburgh, is shaped like a pyramid, 200 feet high, from the designs of G. Kemp (a self-taught architect), with niches for statues illustrative of characters in the works of Scott. Only five have been filled. A *Statue of Scott*, by Steel, is placed underneath. *Royal Institution*, on the Mound, founded in 1819, a handsome Grecian portico, with Steel's statue of Queen Victoria in front, contains a gallery of casts (open every day, except Saturday), and a one gallery of paintings (open Wednesday and Saturday, *free*); here are held the meetings of the Society of Arts, Royal Society, and Society of Antiquarians, offices of the Board of Trade for Manufactures, and Board of Fisheries in Scotland. *National Gallery*, behind the Royal Institution, lately completed, was built for the annual exhibitions of the Royal Scottish Academy, the School of Design, and the institution of a Scottish National Gallery of paintings and sculpture. *University*, on South Bridge, founded in 1582, by a charter from James VI., the present building was begun in 1789, by Robert Adams; there are 32 professorships, divided into four faculties, viz.:--Medicine, Law, Theology, and Arts; a Museum open daily, 6d. (Saturday *free*), and *Library*, 198 feet in length, containing about 1u0,000 volumes. *Royal College of Surgeons Museum*, in Neilson Street, admittance by member's order. *John Knox's House*, foot of High Street, open on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays (6d.), consists of three rooms, the principal object being the chair which belonged to the Reformer.

In this street is situated the *White Horse Inn*, at which Dr. Samuel Johnson arrived on his way to the Hebrides in 1773; *Moray House*, on the south of the street, was erected in 1618 or 162r. Here Oliver Cromwell took up his residence on his first visit to Edinburgh 1618.

*Holyrood Palace* (open daily, 6d., Saturday, *free*) and *Abbey*, the latter being founded for Augustine Canons. by David I., in 112s; the *present palace* is for the most part a building about 200 years old, here Queen Mary was married to Darnley, in 1565; the Gothic tower, doorways, and Chapel Royal, still remain. The palace, which has been partially restored for the Queen, contains a quadrangle in the style of Hampton Court. *Queen Mary's* bedroom and cabinet, with the mark (?) of David Rizzio's blood; in the picture gallery there are about 110 manufactured likenesses of Scottish sovereigns, principally executed by De Witt, a Flemish painter. *Queen Mary's Dial* is in the gardens. *Arthur's Seat*, in the park behind, 822 feet above the level of the sea, is surrounded by a fine carriage-way called the "Queen's Drive;" on the north side is the ruins of a chapel dedicated to St. Anthony the Eremite. *Salisbury Crags* (forming part of Arthur's Seat), is a range of precipitous rocks, and from the road winding round the foot may be seen the cottage of "Davie Deans," rendered famous by Scott's celebrated novel, the "Heart of Mid-Lothian;" in this work is to be had the best description of old Edinburgh.
