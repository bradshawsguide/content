This sea port town is situated on the river Taw, which is crossed by a bridge of sixteen arches. It first became a chartered town in the reign of Edward I., and was formerly surrounded by walls, and defended by a castle. It had also the privilege of a city and a harbour. The streets are well paved and the houses built of stone. The principal manufactures are baise and woollens, chiefly for the Plymouth market. It has also a trade in bobbin net, paper, pottery, tanning, malt, and shipbuilding. Its population is 10,743.
