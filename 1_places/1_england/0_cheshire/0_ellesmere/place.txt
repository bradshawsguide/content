text: A very clean and neat town. Its appearance is much enlivened by a beautiful lake (*Aelsmere*) to the west of which it stands. It is said that from the site of the old castle no less than nine counties may be seen. The church has a pinacled tower, beautiful windows, and tombs, with monagrams of the Kynaston family. *Hardwick Hall*, the seat of the Kynastons, lies about 1Â½ mile west.
