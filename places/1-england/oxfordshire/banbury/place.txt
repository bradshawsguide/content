text: Banbury is situated on the river Cherwell; the navigable canal from Coventry to Oxford passes by this town--and at a distance of five miles it is conveyed through a hill by a tunnel three quarters of a mile in length. In the grounds adjoining the Ram Inn is a well of sulphurated water; and at a short distance from the town is another spring of chalybeate water. The pyrites aureas, or golden fire-stone is often found here in digging wells. A great number of the inhabitants are employed in the manufactory of plush and shag cloth. Banbury is famous for its cakes, cheese, and ale--the former being still sold in the metropolis. Here was the scene of the defeat of the Yorkists at Danesmere, in 1469, when the Earl of Pembroke, with several others, were beheaded.
