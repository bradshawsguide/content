Or *Walton-on-the-Naze*, a rapidly-improving watering-place. Its peculiar appellation of "Soken" was derived from some exclusive privileges formerly granted to certain refugees from the Netherlands, who here established themselves, and introduced several manufactures, particularly that of cloth.

Adjoining the old hall is a square tower, built by the Corporation of the Trinity House, as a mark to guide ships passing or entering the port of Harwich, and on other parts of the coast are two martello towers and a signal station. The church of All Saints was erected and consecrated by Bishop Porteus about forty years ago, the ancient structure having a few years before been entirely swept away by the tides, as well as the churchyard, and every house but one of the old village. In the clay base of the Walton cliffs fossils and elephant tusks, with antediluvian remains of gigantic animals long since extinct, are frequently found embedded. The beach presents a gradual declivity, affording excellent facilities for bathing, and as the ebb tide leaves a fine firm sand several miles in extent, it is also peculiarly available as a promenade.
