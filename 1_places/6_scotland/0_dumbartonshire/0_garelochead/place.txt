text: A small village, situate at the head of Gare Loch, and from whence there is a very beautiful drive along the side of Loch Long to Arrochar, a quiet  though much frequented retreat during the summer months from its delightful situation on the margin, of the loch and in the midst of mountain scenery.

It is only two miles across the pass from this point to Tarbet on Loch Lomond.
