text: Here are the ruins of an old castle of the Kilpatricks, *Closeburn Hall*, seat of Sir J. S. Menteith, Bart., and at Crichup Linn, a fall of 90 feet, was Balfour of Burley's Cave, the retreat of the persecuted covenanters. The scenery around is very romantic. *Glencairn* and *Loch Urr*, lie to our left.
