text: This line diverges to the left at [Llandudno Junction](/stations/llandudno-junction). The valley through which this line passes is described by Burke as <q>the most charming spot in North Wales.</q> It skirts the eastern bank of the Conway, following its various windings. At a distance of two miles beyond the junction we come to the station of [Llansaintfraidd](/stations/llansaintfraidd), the village of which consists of a number of cottages scattered over the side of the hill, to the left of the line. From this point the line passes frequently beneath well-timbered cliffs, on the one hand, and the silent stream on -the other, until we arrive at the next station.

[Tal-y-Cafn](/stations/tal-y-cafn).--Here is a ferry across the river into Carnarvonshire, and in the immediate vicinity two waterfalls, the Porthlwyd and Dolgarrog, the former of which should be seen.
